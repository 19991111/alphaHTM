They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait,
a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties
to Saudi citizens.  And me thinks if the US had not helped out
the Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at 
least the eastern oilfields).  And no Muslim country was doing
much of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi
Arabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating
in favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),
just because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively
rich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.

So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled
back the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???


I think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an
official religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature
like it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the
ones who rise to power.  There are just too many people in this
world (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a 
leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.


You make it sound like these guys are angels, Ilyess.  (In your
clarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)
Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely is
more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who
think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively
enough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the
government was not conservative enough, they have:

	- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom
	  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law
	  brings the death penalty.  

	  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?

	- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who
	  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on
	  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,
	  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should
	  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as
	  prostitutes.

	  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've
	  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving
	  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.
	  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want
	  these women falsely called prostitutes?  

	  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,
	  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind
	  anyone who hates anyone you hate.

	- say that women should not be allowed to work.

	- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.

Now, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government
on earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among
other things.  I just think that the most likely replacements
for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.
But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the
last six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing
by the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women
not fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it
sends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read that
they've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religious
gatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapers
offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who
dare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So the
government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of
the wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.
As unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a small
taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of
Saud, like they're trying to in the long run.

Is this really what you (and Rached and others in the general
west-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)
want, Ilyess?

Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read 
""The Yeast Connection"".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing 
by this ""hated"" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?
Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.
A book that you should be familiar with and not ""hate"". ""Candida species 
colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly 
thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  
Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic 
mycosis.""  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic 
infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or 
""sick"" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent 
parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.
Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute 
it.

What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic 
infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation
(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial 
competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida 
blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: ""However, some factors, such as 
the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to 
both mucosal and systemic infections"".  I was addressing mucosal infections
(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers 
this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the ""cure"".  I guess that 
your nutrition course does not, too bad.  



My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you 
noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.
Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point 
out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, 
pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist 
and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of 
Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.

You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small 
little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in 
Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.
I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what 
I've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into 
""The Yeast Connection"" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain 
and simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never

Probably because it IS rape.


So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn't give any
insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be
dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since
Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better
than ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even
particularly attractive.


Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the
very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there
was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural
diety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against
it means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.


This is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily
documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and
that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or
one's ignorance.  Someone else will address this I'm sure, and refer you to
plenty of documentation...


How is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to
manipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the
coming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is
autmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.


Well, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get
into us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify
exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge. 
If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my
enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will ""feel""
right, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to
be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of
a sudden affliction...
I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were
not.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or
healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect
fanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness.

"From article <C68uBG.K2w@world.std.com>, by cfw@world.std.com (Christopher F Wroten):
Good question.
Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?)
        But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus.
        I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.
        The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but
        they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.
        So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at
        33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.
        So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on
        a 33 mhz cpu.  EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as
        fast as ISA.

That's a very good question.  The EISA bus does have more advantages
over the ISA bus than just it's width.  For example: more/better 
interrupts and bus mastering.  But these other factors do not impact
 a video card very much.  They have more impact on file servers with 
multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.",computer.operation system.ms-windows.miscellaneous,computer hardware.bus architecture.bus performance.bus speed.local bus performance.bus advantages

The first fully international issue has been published and echoes 
are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). 

Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993

Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 
will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured
in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page
-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited
part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for
knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);
and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views
into the discourse.
   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page
expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other
concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,
mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology 
(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this
page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express
their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question.
   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.
The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional 
achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on
one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should
be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the 
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.
   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation
right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.
A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.
   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)
and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.
You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.
On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual
reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing
in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.
   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.
You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete
papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received
several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,
Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed
texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact
person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job.

At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,
and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give
proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail
and by other means.

Sincerely yours,",computer.graphics.error.error,academia.journal publication.call for submissions.editorial guidelines.invited contributions

Bosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves
with Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition.


In Bosnia, ""Muslim"" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic
one as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments
made by people on this subject:

(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims
    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.

(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel
    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.

In 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,
and (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if
Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under
Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any
clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although
Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national
allegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and
historic identity.  So, arguments like ""yes, but your ancestors were
Croats or Serbs"" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what
their ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel
that they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.
What outsiders say is simply not relevant.


In the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when ""Muslim nationality""
appeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result
of a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing
""Bosniaks"" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)
declaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement 
of this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of
""Muslim nationality"" choice in census forms.

For comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories
available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:

Serb-Muslims:                        71,991
Croat-Muslims:                       25,295
Muslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403

This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own
nationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat
nationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have
consistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose ""undeclared"",
in 1953 they chose ""Yugoslavs"", in 1961 both ""Yugoslavs"" and ""Bosniak 
ethnic group"", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose ""Muslim nationality"".

Perhaps the term ""Bosnian Muslim nationality"" is too confusing for
the rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking
about Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some
separate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and
cultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,
because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political
fanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival
dominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,
Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime
as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.",talk.politics.mideast.error,ethnicity.nationality.national identity.national recognition.national categorization

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with
some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec)
into 4800 baud. However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual
proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly
reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a
CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to
spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy
-- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code
without having beaten on it for a very very long time first.

"Hi,
I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi
Galant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.
Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless 
I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a ""popping"" or ""hitting"" sound.
The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say 
this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?
And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK
while attempting to put it in reverse:
   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.
   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is
      fully depressed.
   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.
   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was
      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if
      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)
   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having 
      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),
      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.
   6- The shifter acted normally after that.

When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the 
clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.

I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last
week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because 
Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the
problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while
they had the car.  
In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,
and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed
to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily
solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to
send someone to check the car while it was stuck. 
I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting 
from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get 
the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, 
and with how to handle Mitsubishi.

1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were
performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43
(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.

2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the
Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).

4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was
performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of
two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.

6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.
The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately
20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18
degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back
to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The
RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.

     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,
a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on
May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the
Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test
mini-sequence.

7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees
from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,
back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of
the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was
at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4
degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN
(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 203 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took
place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was
successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with
DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).

2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development
Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current
Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported.

[EE] No, no flaming here. Just a simple question.

...with a simple answer!

[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox
[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is
[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism
[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. 

The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian
Apostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians 
in Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  

[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia
[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.

This is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in
certain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,
Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all
Armenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger 
society.

[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what
[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian
[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion
[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak
[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the
[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian 
[EE] consciousness.

The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless
of the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian
nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later 
stages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to 
Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This 
practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy 
of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these
converted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. 

[EE] Any information will be appreciated.

You answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquiry
was the word Armenian!

The ""artist renderings"" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have
the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree
angle to the Shuttle.  I think the rendering was conceived before the
array replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost
will occur with the arrays deployed or not.  However, it doesn't 
appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.

they have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holes

Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely random
in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be
good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.
With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each
year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.
We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'd
expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.
This is what we actually get--

No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5
Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3
Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3

Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years
of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process
leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.
If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)
that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of
players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping
a coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above
or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from 
the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.
In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there
were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch 
situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of
those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two
years.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and
really horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, 
you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  

Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period
of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 
proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the 
caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage
that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein 
probably never had a ""clutch"" AB against a left-handed pitcher,
but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would
be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his 
platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced
at casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into 
studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the
Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow
you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better
than flipping a coin.  (Self-serving plug follows:  some of the
flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-
coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing.  The
authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug

"This is the AP story from Fri morning.

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader
David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began
looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and 
checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    
compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.
   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the 
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    
since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's 
phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the
cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.
    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel
compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the
women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all
under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    
was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building
it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.
Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling
the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than
the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks
made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to
gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle
headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to 
find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.
  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The
FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult
members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions
at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of 
propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,
it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and
other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked 
together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others
died groping in the blackness.",talk.politics.guns.error,religion.siege and conflict.fire and escape.compound firefight.escape and survival

Quite honestly, this one is ridiculous.  Consider the following
scenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the
runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for
the suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home,
but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down.  It is the
balk rule that prevents this from happening.  

Believe it or not, this actually happened to me once in an OBA
(Ontario Baseball association) game in Milton, Ontario.  I was the

    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall
    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the
    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the
    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was
    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall
    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for
    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about
    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player
    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,
    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that
    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,
    on the resulting PP and
    eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the
    outcome of a game.

    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking
    obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the
level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.
This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.
However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace

  True.  Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church
  leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach
  was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the 
  BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole
  theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces 
  of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds
  played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound
  with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them 
  they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was
  evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up 
  a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they
  broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving 
  relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'
  childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender

Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays
really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths
is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he
allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you
should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third
period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they
would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular
goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they
are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like
Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there 
are any legitimate excuses. 


I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a
relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result 
in a goal. 


In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as
'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty
either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal
only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second 
goal.


What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the 
game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you
could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what
if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final
result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and
email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive
screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie
is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is
focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*
goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.



WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally
unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if
you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key
saves at the key times.


For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in
the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.

                            
I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think
the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've
made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective
(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.

"Hey All-

We have an old (1990) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab.  It had  
given us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab  
has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  
aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics ""SIMMer"").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  
through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  
rectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  
to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  
26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  
down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  
could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  
that we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  
none of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and  
it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain.  Could installing the SCSI  
upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board?  The drive seems to spin up

"Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it:

(Caution: speculation mode engaged)
There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.
I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed
items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would
have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due
to thermal cycle stresses...)

I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are
much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged

It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting, as much as HOW
they have been voting.  Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals
for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this
with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.
Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.

Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members
did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of
Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts
between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties
while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.

I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this
last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that
were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system
was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there
was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.


Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor
party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of
the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored!
Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again
due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party
works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most
political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.

And to answer your question, I ""broke"" with labor because I felt
that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox
coalition members.


Fair enough.  My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility
that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument.
If he was sitting on the committee, then someone else obviously would not
be.  In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to
using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf.

As to the proof presented in this article, I would find it very
interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup
describing how the matter stands/was resolved.

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally?

I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,
etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
orientation). However, it doesn't fit under any of the clever
places I can think of to place it, so I would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

This is probably not a ""newer"" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but
when I bought it, it was a large drive for an average user
(comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). So is my old, 70 meg
drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?

Velarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three
years.  Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but
when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat.
He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but
he hasn't been shuttled around.  I think he's been in New York
ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I
believe.  
I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot
it around either.  I think if Velarde is given a chance,
he could become extremely productive.  I don't have any stats
to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would
cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has
this year.  He has 3 HR already.  Same goes for
Jim Leyrtiz.  He has a big mouth, but he does get
the job done when he concentrates.  I think the situation
with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.  I
think he might have realized something when the Marlins
or Rockies didn't select him.

Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.
To do this, you have to push against something, and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,
the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the 
ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground 
pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  
The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing 
problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which
had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), 
but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel 
toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the 
wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter-

"brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid, and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate.
It's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service. 
I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government,
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys.


But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?  
If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.

If the user is the buyer, what's the service?  
Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service!
Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!

If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying?
The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine -
I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key!

Face it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want.
The only people who want it are the government, not the users.
What you're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes,
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax
(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)

I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency.

Here in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees.  There are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people
refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective.
If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, there are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee.

No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika
proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical
shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The
only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if
he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been
quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the
Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,
and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder
whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those
injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an
earthquake collapsed the root cellar.


Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly
Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong
objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.

Imagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine
hadn't jammed.


Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not
that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there,
and that kind of thing can affect the team.




Exactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury
bugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone
like Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the
choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the
right choice was made for that time period.

RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before
it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.  

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's
orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up,
they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers.
I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit. 

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended
duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support
re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.

THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)
and Orbiter Duration.   

In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,
for a given orbital change.  

From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.

Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the
flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.
The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,
and longer drag life.

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other
after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_
MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.


Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.


Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume
that the general public ""can't handle the truth"" and then, based on this 
assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a
good argument, comes along and asks ""why don't you just develop the spinoffs?""
or ""why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the
military?""  There are some good arguments for space development without relying
on its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think
that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.

controls: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color
	temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off.
video band witdth: 135 MHz

misconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner
dimensions: 16.3""x16.22""x17.64"", weight 42.6 lbs

I don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just 
typed them in.  Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple
dynamic astigmatism focus'.  Right.  They mean they use two lenses.  Advanced
Invar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have
been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,
and blue.  How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me.

   I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars, trucks, and busses, but I think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants, or at the wrong time, or both.

   I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars.  They stink!  And it's always
 roll-up-the-windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when I am driving with my family.

   I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines, and that's why they stink.  So the 
 invisible, unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels.  Yeah,
 well so what!?  Someone forgot about the visible, stinky kind, and,
 as far as I am concerned, those kind are just as bad.

    I am all for de-stinking the diesel vehicles.  It'll keep the
 traffic signs cleaner, too.

I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that
Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has
shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,
and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being
stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a
rock. 

Also remember that a lot of teh ""draft 1st"" stuff comes from the assumption
he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that 
Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock
by any means at this point.

It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his
signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos
suspensions.



No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not
leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to
use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not
when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make
an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can
convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).

That's fascinating.  I take it that you're expressing skepticism
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You
could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any
reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:

   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not
   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our ""founding
   fathers,"" but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany
   Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the
   Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,
   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion
   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express
   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were
   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the
   American psyche.
   ...
      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited
   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors
   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged
   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
   Albany Congress: ""It would be a strange thing...if six nations
   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union
   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should
   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.""
      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs
   and congressional delegates in order to ""hammer out a plan that he
   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.""

That study which was in the NEJM, I think, noted that the frequency
of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in
California (I guess richer people have more heart disease in

Heart surgery was more frequent in California, but mortality and
outcomes were essentially the same.


The only potential problem I see with the private MRI facilty in Calgary is the
self-referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial
interest in it, which is basically unethical...but in Canada because
of our small population, there is likely only to be a few private
facilities involving only a small number of doctors,
and thus I don't think the self-referral problem, which is an epidemic in the
US, could ever get out of hand here.


It is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully.

doctors anticipated that Alberta would need more MRI's, and instead

As a matter of fact, I just saw a dermatologist the other day, and while I

to trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you
can bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this
OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater
can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are
potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall
correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which
is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic
glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.

As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams
of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably

Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)...
I was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were
cleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra ""junk"" put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims
you did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it
was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested
scrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than ""cats"".)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like
to know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise.

BTW, (I named my subject ""Dirty Diesels"" because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd
read it...)

June 25-27.  I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this
year.  I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in
apologetics.  There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers,
fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.

   Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is
available if you need it.  Housing in residence halls (each of which has
its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double
occupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for
you at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night there
for my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner
through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast,
respectively.

   Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on
US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from
campus.

Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the
writings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis,
and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication.
Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving
in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.

                    CATHOLIC CHURCH TEACHING:

              KNOW WHY YOU BELIEVE  June 25-27, 1993

   Times have changed.  Major Catholic doctrines are misunderstood and
attacked.  Like never before, believers need to know the reasons behind
the Catholic Church's teaching.  As our first pope urged: ""Always be
ready to give a defense for the hope that is within you"" (I Peter 3:15).

   Grab your notebooks and get ready for an unforgettable spiritual and
intellectual weekend.  This year's conference will candidly confront the
hardest questions and objections about the Catholic faith.  Deepen your
understanding of Church teaching with _Scott_ and _Kimberly Hahn, Dr.
Thomas Howard, Karl Keating, Dr. Alice von Hildebrand, Dr. Peter
Kreeft,_ and _Fr. Ray Ryland_.

   Cut throught the confusion and doubt, and be better equipped to give
a defense for the hope that is within you.

   Join us at _Defending the Faith IV_, the fourth in a series of annual
conferences designed to strengthen the life of Catholics and others
interested in the Catholic faith.  It can help _you_ know why you
believe.

Unlikely.  Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it
is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding
the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported
by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While

Cliff, do you know the difference between ""Windows"" and ""Win-OS/2""?  Here's
a helpful hint:

Running ""Windows"" under OS/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a DOS
box. Of course, this is only possible with Windows 3.0, since Windows 3.1
no longer has a ""real mode"".

The ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an OS/2 <-> Windows
clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added
by IBM to ""Win-OS/2"".

Now, everybody who is running ""Windows"" in real-mode in a DOS box under OS/2
2.x raise your hand. Finally, everybody who is running ""Win-OS/2"" under OS/2,
raise YOUR hand.

Get the picture, Cliff?

As many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just
not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no
faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the 
_possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render 
that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say
that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't
have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to 
think about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something else
more interesting that occupies your mind.  

I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily
applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to
expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming
reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put 
his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion.

Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its
too heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of 
power for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the
LT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  Why
spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take 
an LT1?  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.)


[talking about Impala SS]

Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17"" aluminum rims and
Eagle GS-C tires.  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read: 
plush police package) with 300 horsepower.

I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get 
their 3.4 DOHC V6 and not the LT1.

So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all

Minor point:  Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but
not with the Jets in mind as the tennant.  The New York Football Giants
had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was
having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee
Stadium until 1972).  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea.
When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the
new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using
the new stadium.  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the
Cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied into
the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to
promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing
with the Mets).  So the deal was worked out.

Diplomatic :-)

I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try to
explain why I feel a mind is necessary. 

Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're
great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not
at working out the method itself.

As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the
simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do
these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.
Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but
in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program
them into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and
write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,
the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already
pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that
our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic
material, much of which isn't used.

One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but
(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see
object X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere.
The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what
conclusions to draw from it's experience.

The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet
people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are
side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,
neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -
can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's
code?

The next problem is the sticky question of ""What is colour?"" (replace
'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the
materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of
chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +
different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a
computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an
algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an
equivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each
algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do
we see colour?



A bit of idle speculation...

If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,
with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called
'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation
and is well known. The second process, called various things such as
'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'),
and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a
'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely
when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly
change the wavefunction.

I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something
else,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable
to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be
the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the
wavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)

Anyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to
be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear
superpositions of anything, although there are alternative
explainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access
part X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too
much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in
physics.

I'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)

and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)
2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out
of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were 
free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers
i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,
but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear
axels, ford 9"" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i 
busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and 
haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to 
rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones
that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly
TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were

That would be Clint Malarchuck.  It was speculated at the time, that
the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end
of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the
ambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he
were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on 
standby.

If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood
there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint
grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.  

Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the
NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,
and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that
he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I
think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.
He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after
that, and then I believe he retired.

Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else
that has been published here about brute force DES cracking, unless Russell
was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be very interested in whether the
program Russell used is available? In whether he used a cleartext
recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
decryption by hand? In whether he used a known plaintext attack?

He probably should also tell us, given his address, what machine he used--a
desktop, workstation, or super-computer.

Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development calling into
question both DES and RSA/DES. Dunno about RSA/IDEA.

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!",computer.graphics.error.error,printing.printing software.printer font installation.printer font conversion

Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is
required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party,
regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price
which is set by the state.  I fail to see how this doctrine can be found
in tort, bankruptcy or contract cases in general.  Well, okay, sort of
in bankruptcy...

*  *  *  *  *


Bang.  Here's one of the places where we widely diverge.  You believe
that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should
consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which
I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute.
_Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party,
Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by
another party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported
Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his
property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop
doing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider
such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to
do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage
faced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case
before the court.


I'd be up in arms?  Why do you assume that?  Quite the contrary, I'd
probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general
doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in
_Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated
for reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's
property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the
hypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's
collective property rights in a healthy physical environment.  What
good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in
your air?

*  *  *  *  *


Yes.  So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights
of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  If
society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights,
fine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less
cement plant.  (See, Ted, I really _am_ a libertarian after all! :-)


""One wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with,
in order to minimize the transactions costs.""???  Which ""one"" are you
speaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights.
Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never
land of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people
are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise ""irrational""
from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to
protect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logically
that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,
so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150
per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't
want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.

*   *   *   *   *


Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because
to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth
Amendment.

As to your ""Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made
whole, because the award of damages in involuntary"" claim, you're at
least partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has
already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place
and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable
price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer
to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might
prefer).  In these cases, the ""sale"" has already taken place and is
irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is
paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should
even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and
(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or
inequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be
worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases
like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it
are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented
from happening at all) by order of the court.

In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the
potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he
agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need
for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both
sides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the
parties themselves.


In cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business.  The
fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into
a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a
result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant
without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose
property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant.
There's nothing punitive or unjust about it.


Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be
required to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the
seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No
injustice, no punitive damages.

*   *   *   *   *


Doesn't sound very much like a libertarian to me.  Libertarians tend to
believe in the rights of individual people, not societies.

*   *   *   *   *


As stated above, the tort was _ongoing_.  Atlantic Cement wanted to be
able to _continue_ to violate Boomer's rights.  While the court may have
been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already
committed, it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the
_future_ violations of Boomer's rights and to then force Boomer to sell
at that price.",talk.politics.miscellaneous.error,law.property rights.eminent domain.property rights litigation.property rights enforcement

	      The format of images created for use by  MS  Windows  3.0/3.1
	      applications  is	documented  in	the MS Windows Programmer's
	      Reference guide.	This guide is intended as a  clearify  some
	      wording	of   the   specifications,   and  to  put  forth  a
	      recommendation among the various alternatives.

	      Please send updates/corrections/suggestions and revisions	 to
	      me.   Please  thank  me  for  writing  this on my own time by

    OVERVIEW

    The DIB image file format is intended to be a ""Device Independent  Bitmap""
    file  format.  (What Microsoft means by ""Device Independent"" is unclear to
    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit
    pixels.

    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.
    If	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-
    swap all short and long integer values.

    By convention, DIB images end in the extension "".BMP"".   This  is  because

    they  are  a  super-set of earlier ""bitmap image files"".  Consequently you
    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as ""BMP"" files.

    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three ""flavors""  of  DIB
    images:
	 o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended	 convention,  and  the
	     form  which I will describe how to create.	 They are intended for
	     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.
	 o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the	flavor
	     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.
	 o   Old-style Bitmap images.

    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS

    The DOS DIB images consist of:
	 1.  A ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file	 as  a
	     DIB  file.	  This	header	also gives the total size of the image
	     file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPINFOHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  If  it  exists,
	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows
	     RGBQUAD structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The OS/2 DIB images consist of:
	 1.  The same ""BITMAPFILEHEADER"" file header which identifies the file
	     as	 a  DIB	 file.	 This  header also gives the total size of the
	     image file, and the offset to the image data.
	 2.  A ""BITMAPCOREHEADER""  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
	     attributes.
	 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.  Again, if  this
	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a
	     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.
	 4.  The image data itself.


    The Old Style image bitmap consists of:
	 1.  Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.	 Which	header
	     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.
	 2.  An optional color palette.	  This	palette	 may  be  composed  of
	     either   Windows	RGBQUAD	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a
	     BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the	header
	     was a BITMAPCOREHEADER).
	 3.  The image data itself.


    CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.

    Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward	steps.
    The headers need to be created and then written to the file.  These header
    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  ""windows.h""	include	 file.
    Palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit
    images.  The five general steps are:
	 1.  Filling  in  the  BITMAPFILEHEADER	  and	the   BITMAPINFOHEADER
	     structures the basic image information.
	 2.  If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the
	     color palette of RGBQUADS.
	 3.  Calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in

	     the ""bfSize"" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 4.  Calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the
	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  ""bfOffBits""	field  of  the
	     BITMAPFILEHEADER.
	 5.  Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER,	the  BITMAPINFOHEADER,
	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).

    The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft  C	 type-
    defined  keywords.	The following table describes these keywords for those
    not familiar with MicroSoft C.

    THE BITMAPFILEHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {
		 WORD	 bfType;
		 DWORD	 bfSize;
		 WORD	 bfReserved1;
		 WORD	 bfReserved2;
		 DWORD	 bfOffBits;
	 } BITMAPFILEHEADER;

    The ""bfType"" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'.	  This	serves
    to	identify  the  file  as	 a  DIB	 image file.  On an intel byte ordered
    machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  C  as  the
    quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.

    The ""bfSize"" field is the total size of the file.  For our	purposes  this
    field  is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times
    the	 size  of  a  RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data.	If the
    image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be
    calculated	ahead  of  time.   Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in
    later.

    Both the ""bfReserved1"" and the ""bfReserved2""  fields  are  always  set  to
    zero.

    The ""bfOffBits"" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data
    from  the  start  of the file.  For our purposes, this field should be set
    to:	 the  size  of	the   BITMAPFILEHEADER,	  plus	 the   size   of   the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times
    the size of a RGBQUAD.  This works out because the image data  is  written
    write after the color palette if one exists.


















			      March 15, 1991





				    - 6 -


    THE BITMAPINFOHEADER

    This structure is defined in ""windows.h"" as:
	 typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{
		 DWORD	 biSize;
		 DWORD	 biWidth;
		 DWORD	 biHeight;
		 WORD	 biPlanes;
		 WORD	 biBitCount;
		 DWORD	 biCompression;
		 DWORD	 biSizeImage;
		 DWORD	 biXPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biYPelsPerMeter;
		 DWORD	 biClrUsed;
		 DWORD	 biClrImportant;
	 } BITMAPINFOHEADER;

    The ""biSize"" field is set to the size of  the  BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure
    itself.   When  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to
    determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  BITMAPINFOHEADER	 and   not   a
    BITMAPCOREHEADER.

    The ""biWidth"" field is the width of the image in image pixels.

    The ""biHeight"" field is the height of the image in image lines.

    The ""biPlanes"" field should always be set to 1.  This data is written  out
    as if there was one color plane.

    The ""biBitCount"" field is the bit-depth of the image.  This must be either
    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.

    The ""biCompression"" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is
    compressed.	   DIB	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.
    However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how
    it works.  Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the
    data is not compressed.

    All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to
    zero.   A  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to
    compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.

    The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be ""biClrUsed"".
    For	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the
    possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  ""biClrUsed""
    colors.  If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may
    only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  Generally,  set
    this field to zero.



			      March 15, 1991





				    - 7 -


    COLOR PALETTES

    Each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  RGBQUAD  structure.	  The  RGBQUAD
    structure is defined in the ""windows.h"" include file as:
	 typedef struct tagRGBQUAD {
		 BYTE	 rgbBlue;
		 BYTE	 rgbGreen;
		 BYTE	 rgbRed;
		 BYTE	 rgbReserved;
	 } RGBQUAD;
    The ""rgbReserved"" field is always zero.  For each color used,  the	amount
    of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is
    written to the file.  A value of zero in  the  ""rgbBlue"",  ""rgbGreen"",  or
    ""rgbRed""   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not
    contribute to the color composition.  A value  of  255  in	any  of	 these
    fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color
    composition.



    IMAGE DATA

    There are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  DIB	 image
    file.   The	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and
    certainly was.

    Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four
    byte  quantity.   So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel
    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The
    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:

		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;

	---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---

		 bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;


    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.
    The	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the
    first line of image data in the file.

    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would
    expect.   One  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit

I don't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS --
I'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  Do you really think
that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent
to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS?

For what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin
for ""candida hypersensitivity syndrome.""  It was published in the 
New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic
symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not
surprisingly).  As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections
to the study, though I don't remember what they were.

Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about
by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)
perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the
fire from the other side?  Like they were surrounded by the fire, and
rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them?

In other words they were TRAPPED by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?

Does that sound plausable?  Not as dramatic as Korash forcing them to

        As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six
different, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on
Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the 
Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek.

        Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all
flattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first.

        Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.  But
I kind of doubt that.


        The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people,
says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of
surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it
slammed in their faces.

        It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to
serve a warrant by knocking on the door.

        There are at least questions that need to be answered.


        This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original
assault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing
concussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press.


        Phill, the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for *forty-five*
minutes.  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would
have retreated immediately.

        If they *were* expecting peacful citizens, why show up with over
a hundred officers, some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying 
sub-machineguns, and *3* National Guard Helicopters?

        I don't know who did what, but, as I said, there are questions that 
need to be answered.

"Hi,

I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events,
so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in 
some sort of 'preferences' file.

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:

 XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData);

This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized
or repositioned using the window manager (mwm).

However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the
window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the
XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure
structure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y).
The width and height memebers are correct.

When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure
structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.

Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?

Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?

I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my
application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values
for the x, y, width, height resources.

Thanks

The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  Jesus' words
seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their
question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.
This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my
opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  Other-
wise, why would Jesus offer ""but are like the angels in heaven"" as a
contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in
marriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,
and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  Or at least,
that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of 
marriages performed on earth.  Your mileage may vary. :)",society.religion.christian.error,religion.marriage.afterlife.afterlife marriages.earthly marriages.earthly marriage validity.post-resurrection marriage validity.post-resurrection marital status.post-resurrection marriage interpretation

There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like
particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However,
there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network.
To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large
part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting
but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest
approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the
occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier
mission like Galileo or Cassini.


It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be
worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly
without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community
has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to
arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly
all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can
reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.


Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things
that can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is
*not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.",science.space.error.error,space exploration.planetary monitoring.atmospheric phenomena monitoring.mission planning.mission feasibility

is resistant to infection, and is non-irritating to surrounding tissue.

Sorry, but this is a red herring.

Are you contending that the ""mountain of forms"" are processed by Blue
Cross?  Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee
and as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between
the two sets of forms.  

Moreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid,
the two primary forms of ""government"" insurance are considerably lower than
the average for private insurance companies.   (5% versus 14%-16%).

If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring
government employees than private employees, post it.  Otherwise, try
to stick to factual assertions.


Well now, that's an interesting defense of the ""free enterprise"" system.
Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents 
private insurance companies from ""standardizing?""

In fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the 
lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US,
but it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than
""free enterprise"" at work.  

By the way, Barron's, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that
administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because ""....a
single-payer system is always cheaper..."".  Guess even the ""free enterprise
advocates"" are beginning to see the light.

I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the
Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous
penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a
match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and
seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for ""delay of game""
for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3
skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans
were starting to come up strong.
I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.
If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not
able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to
admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most
other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the
Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish
spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see
all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best
team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team
looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to
admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team
to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).
But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as
these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)
Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all
ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a
great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience
most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as
a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we
just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers
corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all
Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging
around beeing drunk on ferries...). 
In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you
don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.

but theology is full of reason even if it is, as we believe, based on false
premises etc etc.


hold on there: no meaning to ""consciousness"" or ""mind"" or ""self""?!


what illogicality?


since when is, for instance, (non-behaviourist) psychology a pipe dream? 
Surely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the
workings of the mind.


""manifestations of the mundane"" sounds rather transcendental to me. In fact
""matter"", ""energy"", ""space"" and ""time"" are well measured but mysterious
concepts.

"hey folks,

I'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before.

I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot:  What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents?
In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously
you aren't morally responsible for your actions.  But if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.

Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:

1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying
to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts.

2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')
Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
common by more than one person.  A
mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.
In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and
OOBEs as does in waking life.

3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a
real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe 
different) moral laws apply there.

So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know
of another alternative?  respond by post or email.

thanks very much

"From article <1r0mhtINNa59@cronkite.Central.Sun.COM>, by dbernard@clesun.Central.Sun.COM (Dave Bernard):

I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that
David Koresh had ""explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40
feet into the air.""  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of
opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the
first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas
into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a
fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because
it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't
they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or
similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been
saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.

Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some
time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that
this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I
don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this
so-called ""explosion"" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.
We figure that this is what it was because of how the ""explosion""
looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,
dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion
in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something
that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.

Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four
officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that
some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown
by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they
said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE
THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?
Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the
cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.

What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the
compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade
body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on
the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a
spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this
grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only
people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be
a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,
or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their
face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the
rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the
ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to
make sure that others ""find"" what they want for them to ""find"" if
you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here
but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks
had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.
Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents
used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

   >I'm sure such weapons have been developed.  Our society does not,
   >however, condone their possession or use.  

Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article.

I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn't
make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the
opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose ""the authorities""
might have been a better term than ""society"".  Carry and use a firearm
in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect,
at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do.
And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that
actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.

   In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or
   so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-
   abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny, 
   though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a 
   lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.  
   IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or 
   a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-
   grabbers' logic.  

Agreed.

   You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as 
   important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious 
   good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities 
   about something as big and diverse as US society.

My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable
weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload
of trouble should you be forced to use them.

   Or by the
   naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause 
   to someone who would be a criminal anyway.

I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.  
   
   Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself
   if others' thoughts are not that kindly,

That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to 
have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.

"News:
=====
For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player
remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not 
a major part of the team. 

Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season
game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has
also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. 

Thoughts on Game 1:
==================

The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with
Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing
big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that
was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and 
try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky
Kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames
conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren
Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren
Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. 

Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the
loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got
very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and 
sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off
Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. 

Thoughts on Game 2:
==================

The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the
potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.
The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary
came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring
five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. 

The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary
dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better
use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary
also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up
a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the
game with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when
they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. 

The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he
was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie
Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. 

The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of
Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for
instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato
drew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed
30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct
for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a
fight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and
Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil 
turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at 
each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

   Hi,

   I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this

   My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882
   on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,
   the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but
   I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when
   it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have
   any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.

From what I've heard the PDS slot clock is only 16MHz, to be
compatible with the old LC style boards, while the FPU socket close to
the CPU is clocked at 25MHz.

I guess a board designed for the LCIII can get a 25MHz clock from the
extended PDS socket...",computer.system.mac.hardware,hardware.peripheral expansion.performance impact.bus speed impact.slot compatibility.clock speed.slot performance

I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and
got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed.
The US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of
F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait
which I am not as sure about), doesn't include any US equipment.  Their
missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about
100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal
is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from
other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are
claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it. 

Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly
conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq.  Information
is hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that
fact is classified, and you can't prove it.  If you can provide some
useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq,
I am very interested, but not if you just make claims based on what
""everyone knows"".

recommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It
was not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was
heading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I
should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation
area.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may
have been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is
about 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles
overlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably

A search for illegally held weapons (IF there were any, no evidence yet
produced to this effect) does not justify firing into a house with
women and children, either. It also does not justify shooting first
without identifying oneself (the ATF and FBI have done this before, so
don't say they haven't, please) or producing a warrant.

Guess it depends on whose story one believes, huh?


Which ""others"" are we talking about here?


""Sub lethal""? Excuse me, but those people are dead!!!


Evidence? So far the FBI has produced none. Don't hold your breath.


Only a few of those being held in chains and s(hackles are wanted . 
The rest are being held for the crime of being ""material witnesses"".


It was not the Feds decision to make, but the firefighters.


This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by
ANY citizen. Since fire departments do answer calls that ""deprive 
resources that might be needed elsewhere"" it is not a valid reason for
not calling them.

Further, since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in
a court of law, they are subject to the same protection as any other
citizen. And las far as I know, even criminals in prison are not left to 
burn to death in a fire.


I guess this is a matter of religious faith with you? The government
says it, so it must be so? Or haven't you been reading this thread well 
enough to notice that some of us here don't beleive their story?


Patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires, either.
Besides, as I explained, some of us here believe their distress might
have been genuine. Are you SO certain it wasn't?


There is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice 
either before of after the initial raid. And self-defense is not
murder.


He did not say it was deliberate. Accidents do not require conspiracy
theories, only wanton disregard for human life. The initial raid alone
(agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce-
ment procedure) proves they did not mind killing people.


No one here is ""supporting Koresh"". We are opposing the illegal use of
excessive violence by our government against our citizens. That is all.


A society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious
views will destroy itself in due time. It is the feds who disrupted the
""fabric of society"" in Waco, not Koresh. It is the feds who forced a
nightmare onto the people of Mount Carmel.


On what basis do you assume we haven't? Don't you really mean
""It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from
history that I do?"" :-)


""Militant"" implies acts of aggression against one's neighbors. The
Davidians left their neighbors alone.

.religious heretics who left to set up such a community

So what? The Mormons were considered a ""cult"" for years, and were chased
out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are
advocating. When they finally got to ""set up a community"" they left
people alone. So far Americans haven't been put to the sword by Mormon
hordes crying to avenge Joseph Smith. :-)


It doesn't mean they won't either. Anyway, the whole purpose of a 
system of laws is to punish people for what they DO, not what they
MIGHT do. 


""Telling"" is not the same as ""forcing"". When the police knock at my
door, I cannot make them go away by changing the channeI. As for Pat
and friends, I don't even WATCH their channel, since I am an atheist.
So far, not watching them tell me what to do hasn't gotten me killed :-)


Right now, the only people sticking guns in anyone's faces is the 
government. And they are trying very hard to run my life. Or 
haven't you noticed?

Oh, yeah.  This is a fine place.  We haven't had the ""why does concrete

The concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains
them into the ground.

Another explanation, implausible as it is,  is that the lead-acid battery
needs to be periodically charged (topped-off), otherwise the battery
self-discharges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction.

Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.
The point is that theism is *a* factor.
 
 
 
That's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the
field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.
 
 
 
That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to
fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,
there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.
 
Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.
 
 
And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.
 
 
 
That's bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.
 
Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics

   Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By 
   the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, 
   the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round
   trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as
   5000 kg in a Low Earth ""advertising"" orbit: Very roughly the
   same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were
   to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...

This is nonsense.  Its like saying that by the time commercials
on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own
hour long nationally broadcast TV program.

   There's always been a problem of having to get 
   away from civilization before you can really find ""natural""
   scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip
   of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles
   or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards
   on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still
   ""wild."" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital
   billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of 
   growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will
   not save your view of the night sky, because by the time 
   such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
   finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_

                         OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS
                         FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY

     Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai (""homosexuals"") in 1 Cor 6:9
and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,
specifically homosexualitiy.  Some restrict the term's meaning to ""active male
prostititute,"" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,
namely ""homosexuals.""  More recently the definition ""homosexual"" has been
opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term
""homosexuals"" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional
rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. 
A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only
factor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of
arsenokoitai by ""homosexuals"" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. 
Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it
from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation
and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline
(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).

                                   INTRODUCTION

     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has
been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or
sodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used
twice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous
scrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since
so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, 
the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church
and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.

     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and
evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence
to point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the
modern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have
provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider
acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the
ministry.

I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery,
and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  Ordinary massage
is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular
or joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners
who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be
quack science to justify their technique.

In the case of massage, there is a technique called ""deep abdominal massage""
in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!
The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease
syndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that
these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.",science.medical.error.error,medicine.quackery.alternative medicine.unorthodox medical practices.unorthodox massage practices.extreme massage practices.extreme therapeutic practices.extreme abdominal massage practices.deep abdominal massage practices.deep tissue massage practices.deep abdominal massage techniques.intestinal cleansing practices.intestinal cleansing claims

This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood
the trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,
at the same time, he is God's son ""For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son"". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could
he really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost ""planted the seed"" in Mary, so to speak,
then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the
human father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's 
qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try
and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that
case, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship
isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God
incarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God
manifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone
who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? 

Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid
to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would
rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing
how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body
may have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical
pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.
The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much
meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only
one was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very
offensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my
sincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.
But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.
 
[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.
First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this
group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You
seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense,
with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that
terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin
Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.  But it doesn't
imply that God's sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means
the only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material.

Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a
Trinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is
a part of God.  The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.
Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn't
specifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it's the Son
who was incarnated.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.trinity.incarnation.divine nature.divine relationships

post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within
one minute or so of the game  ending.

As for the earlier comments about CBC being ""Ontariocentric"" frankly
the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant  see
the Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The
reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising
for six hours of hockey in  one night.

 As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. CBC always gets
plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.

Charlie Brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use
the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  Note, though, that
you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it
may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.

The things are easy to dismantle.  The key piece of information is that
when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the
film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when
the camera is made.  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's
standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.

All the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables
is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,
and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in
another.  If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery
(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and
pieces from the camera.

I expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really
determined.",science.electronics.error.error,electronics.photography equipment.camera disassembly.camera components.battery and component recovery.camera recycling.flash camera disassembly.camera reuse

Well, they never should have gotten into this situation.

Look at the history of this group. David Koresh has been arrested
?twice?  by local police. Both times, he accepted the arrest warrant
and went peacefully. So, the feds decide to arrest him. How do they
choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under
arrest? They throw a concussion grenades at his building. 

In addition, we KNOW that we've been lied to. Initially, we were told
that they suspected him of molesting children and having several
wives. But these are NOT ATF offenses, were they? So they changed
their story, several times. And the original warrant is STILL sealed.
And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did
anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? They claimed that Koresh
hadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing
him just a week before the raid.

How would I have handled it differently? 

Well, first, I haven't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything
wrong. There's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which
keep changing about what they did. So I might not have done ANYTHING.

OK. Now, supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for.
Well, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, I send
officers to the door with a warrant. Wearing bulletproof vests.
Covered from a distance by sharpshooters. Now, there's no good reason
to suspect that these people will do anything, right? Why didn't
anyone TRY serving a warrant?

OK. Going further. They refuse the warrant. It becomes necessary to
raid. You plan a raid. You hear an hour before that there was a leak,
and they know your coming. SO what do you do?  Well, change your
plans, right? Nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including
sending in unprotected men to break into the place. It was idiotic. I
don't know what I would have ended up doing. But that original raid
should NEVER have happened.

The shit that came later should NEVER have happened.

The full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us
know what the hell really happened there.

The lies should NEVER have been told.

1. do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the
   executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer.  These are
   available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
   fee.

2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also
   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right!

3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
   pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1
   on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok
   but assumptions are bad).

4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct,
   then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.

WOW!  Another Clayton wannabe.  Typical response: lack of logic.

Define 'deviant':  someone who deviates from the normal.  Ok, so far.
Define 'normal':   erm, umm.  If you define yourself as normal then it is for
you to prove that you are (within limits, which then brings in the question,
what are the limits?  For you we may have to broaden them to other's intolerance
;-) ) 'normal'.  Difficult to prove.  From what you have posted it must follow
that `normal` to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice.
But it does look as if you went to the Clayton school of logic, doesn't it?


Again an astounding lack of logic!  Wow!

You must define what you say such that everyone agrees.  Here you have used
the phrase ""sexual deviant"".  How in the hell do you define that?  As someone
who does something sexually that _you_ don't?  By this definition you most
probably mean the majority of the planet.  How do you know that your next
door neighbour doesn't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then
have it licked off by his wife?  Is this sexual deviancy?  How do we know
that you don't like something sexually which others may find repulsive?  Is 
having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy?  Please be more specific, and
where you do, back up your claims.  Or I may have to go to hospital due to
laughing too much at yours and Clayton's postings.

Secondly, if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' means
such people as homosexuals, bisexuals &c. (basically everyone you don't like),
I think that your phrase ""do not comprise a `political minorit[y]`"" (why the
brackets?) is a non-sequiteur.  Gay groups exist which lobby their governments.
That is a fact.  Prove it false.  Hence they are a politial group.  You 
state that they are not a political minority.  Are they therefore a
political majority?  I think you boobed really big on this one.  Try thinking
about your arguments.


Prove the first statement please.   Dates, phone numbers, &c.

Again your logic fails.  Again you make statements which you cannot
(and most probably will not) maintain.

You state that a person (girl, in this context) who considers equal rights
for all humans to be an airhead?  As Clayton (your best mate?) would say:
it just shows how screwed up you are.

 

Proof please.  Proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order.
Proof that nature has always asserted itself.  Are you saying that nature
is a conciousness?  Are you pretending that you have the ability to see the
future?  Are you god(tm)?  In fact, by your arguement, are you waiting for 
the black people to become slaves again?  Because they were reviled as
sub-human (nb: *not* my view) at one time?  Again your arguement falls
on its ass.



Touchy touchy touchy!

Right.  I have shot holes in each and every one of your arguements.  You are
most probably going to put me in your kill file because you have no answers
to my questions and challenges.  Since you cannot support your arguments it
merely goes to show that what you write is based upon your personal prejudices,
and cannot be taken to be fact of any kind.

I await an intelligent response.....

Why do many (?) people believe that Xhibition '93 is one of the ""paid
market hype NT conferences"" (as you put it)? I for one am going, because
I, too, am curious about the technology. I think this is a great chance
to learn about NT, mainly because:

  - It will be presented in X's ""home turf"". I believe that the attendees
    will mostly have X backgrounds (biases? :-); thus, I expect that the
    NT presentations will face a tough audience.

  - I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what
    it is hyped to be. This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the
    NT technology without actually using it myself, which I don't have the
    time to do.

  - If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored, there will be
    many other interesting tutorials/presentations that I won't have to
    waste my time ... in California?!?  :-)

"Wm Hathaway comments;



I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to
impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to
somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment
of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded
by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be
sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,
our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts
that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,
not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all
of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach
that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the
'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally
unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern
sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.
I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,
just because it has changed the way we strive.

BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make
it better.

Isuzu Trooper:

	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to 
	park in in San Francisco. No Thanks.


Chevy Blazer:

	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still 
	too small.

Ford Explorer:

	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.
	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would
	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and
	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like,
	but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get
	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10"" shorter
	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual 
	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. 


	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?

I once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this.
""Christianity is a Higher Logic.  Athiest like u will not be able
to understand it.  Your atheist logic is very low.  Only thru faith can 
we understand the Higher Logic in God"".

So I asked him, ""So what is this Higher Logic?""

His answer, ""I don't know.""

This, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about
xtainity.  It is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that
their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore:
to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as
the ones above and those such as, ""How can u trust science, science
was invented by man!"", only goes to further show the weakness of
their religion.

In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains
never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.
They know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature
of their faith.
They would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort
him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.

Never in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's
""reasonable"".  Rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement
against ""reason"" above).

I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3)
something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be.
Namely, that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to 
establish a police force for Haiti.

I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it,
nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved
in internal conflicts.

That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse
lot - the UN (Security Council).

And while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in
most articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship
under the UN Sec. Council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press
and then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a ""civilized"" 
country that they have left behind.

Note I don't support this idealized concept, simply because I think it is a
lot of hogwash.

Secaris is reasonably inexpensive ($6.00 Cdn for a tube), and is indeed an

                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                IN PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH VACLAV HAVEL
	     
	     
                           The Oval Office 
	     

5:00 P.M. EDT


	     Q	  Mr. President, President Havel is here for the 
Holocaust Museum opening, and you toured the museum last night.  All 
this focus on the Holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision-
making process as far as Bosnia is concerned?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think the Holocaust is the most 
extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing.  And I 
think that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that 
should be opposed.  You couldn't help thinking about that.  That's 
not to compare the two examples.  They're not identical; everyone 
knows that.  But I think that the United States should always seek an 
opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against 
inhumanity.
	     
	     Q	  Sir, how close are you to a decision on more 
sanctions on Bosnia?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, of course, we've got the U.N. 
vote.  Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to 
strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough.  And we now are 
putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at 
what other options we ought to consider.  And I don't have anything 
else to say, except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on 
it and will continue to over the next several days.
	     
	     Q	  Following your meeting today, sir, are you any 
closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I have not made any decisions.

with Mr. Havel?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm just honored that he would 
come and see me.  I'm glad he's here in the United States for the 
dedication of the Holocaust Museum.  He is a figure widely admired in 
our country and around the world, and a very important person in 
Europe, and a very important person to the United States.  So I'm

I was simply observing that as a non-Jew, I am not in that community
which might be bound by such a decision (I don't know much about
the Council of Jamnia, but I have heard that it is not well-attested
historically). 'Faithless' has nothing to do with it, and I prefer
not to speculate about motives.


I wish the Dialogue_with_Trypho were a real transcript of a real
dialogue,, but I think it a fictional effect on Justin's part.
Putting that to one side, Justin's point may be evidential; one
would want to know- 'which books?'


Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light (MS evidence)
they had. Let's stick to the issues. Again, I prefer not to speculate
about motives. One would need quotes from Luther, Calvin, etc. to
evidence this 'preference'.

Is this the principle: 'Any (BC) text not quoted by Christ cannot
be counted as Scripture' ? Think well about this- Job, Ruth...?

 		These is a logically invalid *a priori*. 
 		Besides, we are talking about OT texts- 
 		which in many parts are superceded by the NT
 		(in the Xtian view). Would not this same
 		principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_?
 		This principle cannot be consistently applied.

Dave W. answers:
 

Meaning what? Do you affirm the principle (that the D.c's can be
excluded since they contain 'false doctrine') or do you deny it? 
If affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine 
that doctrine X is false? Do you affirm every teaching in _Ecclesiastes_?


If so, it may be a test that cannot be applied. The Orthodox
faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical. How can my
faith say 'Not!' ? All I hear here is the *a priori* I mentioned
before.


This is contrary to fact.


Can this be elevated to a principle? How is 'spiritual quality'
measured? I'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of Sirach over 
Joshua or Chronicles, any day.


What can I say? You believe what you believe- I'm asking for
a consistency check. I don't see that the books were added- in any
construction this formulation begs the question. No one can validly
ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical.

    You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory.
I work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds
of computers per year.  It never fails, machines come in with BAD SIMMS.
Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed
I can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or

    Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results I
have gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work.
The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good.  I would
be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft
or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once
in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.

just crashed and they lost thier work.  In case your wondering, or if you
haven't already guessed I work in an IS department.  Service is a do or die
perogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS:  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED
with a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software
programs that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated little
beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.

If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
which are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, and
besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity

The Shannon limit for voice lines is likely somewhere around 25kbps.
We are rapidly approaching it. The fastest affordable full-duplex
modems currently on the market are V32bis, which is 14400bps.


CELP manages to sound decent at 4800 bps.

In theory, if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice
into ASCII, and a perfect synthesis system on the other end that
sounded just like the person you were speaking to, you could get it
down to the information content of the speech.

With various kinds of LPC, you can get it down to 2400 bps or prehaps
even less, at which point it sounds horrible.

4800 bps is more than adequite for our purposes.

No, if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field, it produces a voltage.
The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or
move the conductor.  The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't
really significant, especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic
field is to begin with.


Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel
the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course,
this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has
to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the
earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require
some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.
And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).  And the
physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our
blood, among other things).  In other words, forget it.

As the program on a CD-ROM would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is
impossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a

I have a floppy drive which has developed ""General failure"" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5"" drive).

I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.

However, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.

Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it.

could be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?

It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself
I'm sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend
the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about
Tongues (I'm reading ""Charismatic Chaos"").  I guess I'll study
Tongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can 
give me will be appreciated.

    -------------------------------------------

[I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than
you (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a
different tradition than yours.

This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics
generally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The
issue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants
generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.
Since this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would
understand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants
don't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the
Church, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.

I interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about
whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am
not prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in
learning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of
course a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally
consider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and
various subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matter
of how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major
division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those
who don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,
but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd 
identify the major Protestant traditions as:

  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between
  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,
  Church of Christ

But there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to
be so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think
current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make
conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general ""evangelical""
perspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still
quite marked.

I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book
on church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really
needs to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history
will normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and
give a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from my
library at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.denominations.mariology.idolatry.traditions

faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications.  Plus, a 50MHz

Haven't been to many A's games, have you?

Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts
a long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't
like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going
on in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or
pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow
walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason
(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of
reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).  

I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy
watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much
dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch
it on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like
that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game
(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next
year: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next
year, and they're going to a 35 second clock).  

There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm
watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going

Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the

NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,
NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you
wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you
use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that
SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just
implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well

it.

I quote from the journal, ""30 Days In the Church and In the World,""
1992, No. 8/9, p. 29. 

Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism:

	In procuring the common good of society the need could arise
	that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot
	cause harm.  By virtue of this, the right and obligation of 
	public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties,
	including the death penalty, is acknowledged.  For similar
	reasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede
	aggressors in society with the use of arms.  The Church's 
	traditional teaching has always been expressed and will 
	continue to be expressed in the 
	consideration of the real conditions of common good and the
	effective means for preserving public order and personal
	safety.  To the degree that means other than the death
	penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the
	peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred
	because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the
	final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.  

As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capital
punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total
accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly
force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.

union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.

Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism,
which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with
Christ by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the
advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their
baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.

Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in
the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add
to their baptism faith and obedience.

Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the
basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of
God. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a
punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.



Do you teach a child to pray the Lord's prayer? Do you expect them to not
steal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition. And in the
new covenant, we shall no longer say: know the lord, for they shall all
know him from the least unto the greatest Heb 8:11.


But also according to Ezekiel 18, God will not hold innocent anyone on the
basis of anyone elses innocense. Thus Jesus could not be our federal head
any more than adam, *IF* that's what ezekiel is talking about. Shall you
make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well?


  >

Ezekiel 36:25-26 indicates that this new heart will be given by God,
in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. It is the action of
God puting them into his new order, and not a question of""personal""
faith as such.


But the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal
death, but the dead state (originbal sin). We are in a covenant of death,
because adam, our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death.



While this psalm is figurative in it's language, it is not hyperbolic, and
the one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other
hyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is 
what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and
childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The
whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt
offering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as he
did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have. 

But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was 
passed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to be
cut. That's why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies
were born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in
baptism today.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.baptism.baptism theology.baptism and faith.baptism and grace

I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause
me to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a ""moment of
silence"" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of ""allowing"" for religion
amongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need
more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are
required by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also
has requirements that are not addressed by this.

There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in
this ""moment of silence"" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that
Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally
incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews
as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some
characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special
times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer 
being able taking note of it.)

A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of
his activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the
other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME
forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant
""mainstream"" religion.

All that a ""moment of silence"" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which
doesn't NEED it, to have a ""special"" place set aside in the public schools.
There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,
or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A
Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during
the day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-
Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the ""moment of silence"" it
would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims
to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed
forms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,
the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.

Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as
a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),
and a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political
forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms
on non-Christians.

As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this ""moment of
silence"" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE
children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And
as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I
suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --
it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in ""making""
their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach
what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in
the world to do so.

If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of
silence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment
will only embarrass you.

contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current

(1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or

(2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy
a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some
point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.  
Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work.

Agreed, so I won't respond again.  It's important for all you spacers out 
there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that 
have been presented.  Just like Congress, it would be best to consult

I'm afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in _EH_. 
I don't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain

The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus' statements, 
""...whilst if there were any at all, that attempted to pervert 
the sound doctrine of the saving gospel, they were yet skulking

""Favorably interpreted?"" Just in looking at two of the four 
references that you gave (I have the _EH_ handy, Irenaeus and the 
_Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for) I see no room for 
such 'interpretations.'

And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to 
the Temple Ceremonies. 

The links for Jay's using _EH_ for support are: ""imparting the gift

Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks, Uncle Sam!).  I've been

you're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind the
ear models, that's not an issue).  The cost:  I paid $1200 each for mine,

Stole 300 bases.  (Ok, he's still light-hitting, but baseball managers don't
think so, they think he, like Omar Moreno before him, is a perfect leadoff
man.  Awesome defense.)


He's still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR.


Hasn't played 10+ years in the bigs.  Wasn't a full-time major-leaguer
until 1988.


Consistent .300 hitter.


We'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.


Same goes for Herm.


Doesn't count then.


Redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases.  Close to
800 OPS career against LHP.


We'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify.


Slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters'
parks in the NL.  He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this
year.  Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver
and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox.


Coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being
weak offensively, though of course he was.  Led NL in SB his first six
years in the majors.


We'll see if he's still around in 1997.


Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year
stretch and led the league in triples five times.  But we can count him
if he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon
deluxe with slightly worse defense.


Okay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also
in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome.


He's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man.


Halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there.


Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as
light-hitting.  Neither was Curt Flood.  Cesar Cedeno was *not* light-

"molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video
recording equipment.
 
Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization.
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           first-come first-served basis.
 
Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken
           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,
           X-windows and C is useful but not required.

Cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
        2 credits           $820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.
 
Content (may vary)
 
    Elements of computer graphics
         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric
         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow

"Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes
the theory of a succession of lives.

I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as
choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done, since they had not been born
yet.

Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor
does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had
had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, ""Neither of them
has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born.""

Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate
Easau when Esau has done nothing bad?

I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when
what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example,
consider the saying in Matthew 6:24

 + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one
 + and love the other, or....

Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one
of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in
second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby
calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call
simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take
second place. In our original example, second place means that
Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and
obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ.

Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the
Baptist:

 + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come.

I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing
and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the
prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah.  I do
not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently,
neither did he (John 1:21).",society.religion.christian.error,religion.reincarnation.scriptural interpretation

"Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial
     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or
     will he assume the superstition of his parents
     when questioning? 

I've often found it to be the case that the theist
     will stick to some kind of superstition when
     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've
     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,
     and the other theists alike.  All assume that
     their mothers and fathers were right in the
     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief
     search for their god.
     
Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or
     aspects of the same religion, but overall the
     majority keep to the belief that some ""Creator""
     was behind the universe's existence.  I've
     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice
     versa, I've known Christians who were once
     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known
     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout
     their transition from one faith to another,
     they've kept this belief in some form of higher
     ""being.""  Why?
     
It usually all has to do with how the child is
     brought up.  From the time he is born, the
     theist is brought up with the notion of the
     ""truth"" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,
     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told
     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)
     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in
     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.
     He is also told that to question this (as
     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime
     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-
     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.
     Thus, by the time he is able to read the
     scripture for himself, the belief in its ""truth""
     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
     matter of course.
     
But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able
     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to
     inculcate the child the ""right"" readings of
     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant
     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to
     explain away the unexplainable with ""mystery.""
     Circular arguments, ""self-evdent"" facts and
     ""truths,"" unreasoning belief, and fear of
     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath
     of some sort, and the child must learn to put
     away his brain when the matter concerns God.
     All of this has some considerable effect on the
     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the 
     superstitions he's been taught are nearly
     impossible to remove.
     
All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,
     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.
     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that
     God *does* exist and look at everything from
     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most
     theists can somewhat, especially when presented
     with ""mythical gods"" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,
     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption
     of God's existence and question it impartially?

I think you're both right.  Teflon was actually discovered by accident
before WWII.  From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it
was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.
Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.

The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say
the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  What the space
program did was to find a way to get it to stick.  Thus we had no-stick
frypans on the market in the late '60s.

This is certainly not the case.  There is no significant *ability* toi
perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a game-winning hit.  The ""clutch pitching"" quoted above is
something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher.



Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,
standard deviation about 30).  There will be such hitters in any league,
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.

And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to
pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past.

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.
Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of
Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?

I don't have a stat, but, unfortunately, I did read generally that both smoking
and belief in the supernatural (occultish garbage) is on the rise here.



This is very interesting.  I thing the principle is sort of the same though:
all ""philosophical"" ideas are generally tried out and tested mostly during
college years.  Whether the idea is christian or atheist doesn't always matter.
But I'd like to say it's because atheists are more intelligent  :)

""Muslim"" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, not
all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)
exist in ex-Yugoslavia ""Christian Muslims.""  Tito defined the Muslim 
nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:
Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. 

Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, ""Muslim""
is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who 
differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not 
a ""Christo-Slavic"" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, it
was the ""Atheist Communist"" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there was
no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  

The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all*
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements. ",talk.politics.mideast.error,politics.nationhood.nation definition.nation formation

"Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...
  
   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried
out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some
time.  A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion
Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-
0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper
describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve
aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems
associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed
airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane
   The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the
paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000
pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and
life support.  System design reliability is .9995.
   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets
and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-
long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-
stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy
payload on an expendable second stage.
   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a
normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,
modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,
would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing
out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like
aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.
   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff
is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.
The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs
of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust
rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,
with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-
25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would
be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's
success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact
tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.
     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude
while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,
cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater
safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle
and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major
use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-
ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide
as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical
configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can
be shown to be operationally viable.""
  
   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for
some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL
SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-
examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.
   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going
studies trying straighten out the government's future space
transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)
are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are
various factions and options vying for attention -- including
shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3""
architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced
vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,
etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy
for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to
juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against
medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against
the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies

that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens

final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.

"I am writing this to find out the following:

1.)	Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.

2.)	The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.

3.)	Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.

My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with 
reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  At that time he 
saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, 
Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  
These treatments were not effective and because the damage was 
worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told 
there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen 
wrap and a ""Hill Repair"".  He opted for the ""Hill Repair"". He recovered 
very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse 
and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).

The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him 
that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition 
which he called ""Barrett's Syndrome"". If he can't avoid having reflux will 
he necessarily get cancer?

Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd 
appreciate it.

Brian, does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient
Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of
Christianity? I hope you are not Catholic, because my Christian
upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther, and the one of

"Robert,

I'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion.  I've 
been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.
I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just 
like I haven't read ""The Yeast Connection"").

Let me just start by stating that the authors of the ""Cold Fusion"" papers of 
recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually 
left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a 
review of the research notes of the ""cold fusion scientists"" actually 
proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.

Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay 
texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food 
combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.
But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent 
oxidative damage in the body).

Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove 
that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you 
use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees 
I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in 
commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this 
kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I 
couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really 
guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is 
that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to 
produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so 
they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. 

Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and 
in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve 
fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we 
really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with 
silicon?  Not in my book Robert.

Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation 
that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon 
based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I 
know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to 
separate the fiction from the fact.

Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in 
humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing 
there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know 
about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not 
because silicon is transformed into calcium).

Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective 
tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show 
that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective 
factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, 
the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity 
which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as 
part of the ageing process in humans).

For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which 
calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon 
in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the 
bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.
Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming 
cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in 
the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency
(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of 
defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also 
another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  
undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not 
transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing 
observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into 
calcium is an interesting little trick.

But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and 
yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without 
a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group 
are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any 
better).

If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, 
I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources 
that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems 
to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm 
going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us 
kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.

For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's 
interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric 
neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his 
name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in 
our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with 
brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses""unconventional""
treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one 
case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional 
treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the 
cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between 
radiation treatment and surgery is guys? 

I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the 
chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)
and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which 
do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it 
because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?
How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your 
sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).",science.medical.error.error,biochemistry.biochemical reactions.biochemical processes

I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no
anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe
because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a
20mg dose didn't work.

Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. 
Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm
having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the
Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.

My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many
side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work
at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.


Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much
experience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe
him.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my
family practitioner's office.

have been disrupted by Hamas actions overtly directed towards

there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types
of common incidents.
 
 Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under.  I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.
What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?
I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a
justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.
 
 My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police
departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.  Overall, I thought that I
had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were
useful.
 
 
 Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
or the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will see
that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that
400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access
to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between
1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the ""statistics"".

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is

that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New
Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for
example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the
names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be
made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that
there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and

Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read.  The system may
not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but
it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some
suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys
from escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's
coercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone.

I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.
The original title perhaps should have been ""Distinction between legal
and illegal cipher systems considered harmful"", but ""Clipper considered
harmful"" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.

Assumptions:

  1.  Clipper is made available.

  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal
      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws
      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio
      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper
      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such
      detection a cause for further action.

  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be
      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum
      some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and
      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.
      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a
      red flag.

  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper
      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof
      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones.

  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not
      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper
      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that
      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably
      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the
      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because
      each one has a unique unit key.

  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they
      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because
      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be
      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly
      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise
      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under
      immediate suspicion.

  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,
      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.

By #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper
phone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one's
association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips
around, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is
associated with someone else.

A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure
communications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,
or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from
reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted
communications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,
but the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying
or abandoning the phone before T elapses.

It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper
phone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone
else's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion.

This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion
and collusion.

Coercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes
a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from
a car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen
from someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to
arise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor
criminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone
who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected
communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.
The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means
that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of
freshly coerced phones.

There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively
wealthy criminals, and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money,
and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper
phone service for someone else's use.

Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a
Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal
cellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to
their stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use being coerced must
first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and
have its keys obtained from escrow.

Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance
mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,
can validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.

Whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium
would stand out, a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper
medium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk
recordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper
chip is fractured.

If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge
the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be
using someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you against
whatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be
able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you
identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.

The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than
they were before Clipper came along.

I therefore consider Clipper harmful because:

  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against
      aggressive or dishonest government.

  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct
      criminal threat to the honest public.

  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to
      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than
      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring
      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.

  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors
      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime
      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key
      escrow is claimed to help against.

  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting
      of ""illegal"" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher
      machine...",science.cryptographic.error.error,privacy.encryption.security.cipher_systems.cipher_systems_abuse

  Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a
  term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, ""God must exist, because
  he wouldn't be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really
  doesn't!""  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological
  proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among
  others?",alternative.atheism.error.error,religion.proofs of god.argument for existence.argument quality

"Hi everyone,

I'm trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I can't hear
God talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and
that he knows me, and I feel that I can't possibly get to know him until
he does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just don't know or understand
how to listen.

Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God
is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover.
This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit
frightening, but I have a few questions.

1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, ""OK God, her you
go, I'm committing my life to you"", I wouldn't really feel that he'd
listened - at least, I couldn't be sure that he had. So how does one (or
how did you) commit oneself to God?

2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my
current life? What can I no longer do? I feel that I'm as 'good' as many
Christians, and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - I
don't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get
jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the
standards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what
do I have to give up?

3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if
any) burdens am I taking on?

4) So then, what's the general difference before and after? I assume,
that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it
won't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens?

5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find
out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?!

Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. Perhaps
e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.spiritual journey.seeking faith.commitment to faith.seeking guidance.understanding commitment.exploring commitment.commitment practices

I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little
justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an.
In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. 
Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there
is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have
been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.

However, when an apostate makes attacks upon ""God and
His Messenger"" the situation changes. Now the charge of
apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps 
charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person 
makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public
attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the
situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads
slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation
changes. The punishments vary according to the situation
the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated
apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.

There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation
and being in the situation where someone unilaterally
wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. 
against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm 
to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could
be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is
a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two
clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange
prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated
individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, 
the unilateral attack and the spreading of ""fasad"" that 
would apply in the case of Rushdie.

The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an 
offensive book (banning the book is secondary) -
a full set of circumstances following the publication of
the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many
Muslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.




I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe
that one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.
Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding ""circumstance of
revelation"" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the
verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance
in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say
that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the
Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when
they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life
situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can
all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal
relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that
arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how
each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.
It is not necessarily a simple ""this or that"" process. There may
be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in
which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters
impinge on the situation.

In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an.
The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must
entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.
If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each
person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.
However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to
the
State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,
the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there 
are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one 
should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of 
these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:

""...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating
verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,
and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between
a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of
Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances 
of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of
the Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the
knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and
delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from
the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning
from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,
the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,
and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the
subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the
detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the
duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and
does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those
coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know
the Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an...."".

Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anic
verses (""Why should not a company from every group remain behind 
to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn 
people when they return to them, so that they may beware."" (9:122)),
a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements
for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on
matters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major 
divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these
headings.

- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).
- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.
- Logic (mantiq)
- A knowledge of Hadiths
- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)
- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus,
Reasoning)

The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:
- discussion of imperatives (awamir)
- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)
- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)
- discussion of unconditional and conditional
- discussion of tacit meanings
- discussion of the abstract and the clear
- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated

The principles of Application of the law involves:
- principles of exemption
- principles of precaution
- principles of option
- principles of mastery

The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process
in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter
of looking at one verse and one hadith. 

Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference
between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is
clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the
""The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as 
long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,
and wealth of this world."" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: ""O Messenger
of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?"" He (S.A.) replied:
""By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for
your religion and shun them."" I do not yet know enough about the Imams
of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies
to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.

The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as ""The fortress of Islam"". My only
point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into
play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is 
delineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise
are praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite
knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion 
are cautioned.

The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this
group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,
apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least
base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a
heretic
because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of
creating a straw man and then beating him.


I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.
Unfortunately,
I do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated
group
is out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like

"I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it.
I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v.
I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same
name:  the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard
sunroof. 
Oops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !!
So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the
two models of the Jetta GLI ?
More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ?  There are
no badges that said ""16v"" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version.
Assuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid
reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ?

	Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than
you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed
HDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,
even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm
guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).

	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.

	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier

No wonder you clown are in such a mess. Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an 
Armenian Dashnak sociolog) book, ""The Armenian Community"", pages 97 and 
105. Atamian quotes:

 ""... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and
 tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia, the immediate aim of
 the Party, was to be attained by:

      1. Oral and written propaganda.
      2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure
         of self defense. 
      3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be
         equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared
         for a general uprising.
      4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with
         each other and subject to a central body.
      5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters.""

Now, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution:

 ""... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained?
 By:

      1. Propaganda 
      2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination
      3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people
      4. The arming of the people
      5. Organization of revolutionary committees
      6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with
         the official bodies and journals
      7. Organization of financial zones for public collection 
      8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government
         officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors
      9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry
     10. Building of roads for the transport of arms
     11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions.""

Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people 
were committed by the brainwashed members of the ""Tzeghagron"", namely, 
""race-worshipers"" of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically, again, 
Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi, Karekin Nejdeh,
in 1941 (see Atamian, loc cit, page 389).

Ok, so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy
computer algorythims, but have you looked ad the Hubble results, the
defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software (see
those jupiter pictures for results), but is the effects are completely
reversable, why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it?

The way I see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in
the butt if i'm out of the ball park), the astromers are making the
best of limited possiblities, there's only one hubble, and the shuttle
makes another in the near future a non-thought.  Perhaps those self
same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind

"Hi everybody out there,
I just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of WindowsNT
and still am not able to boot up that system. The final step
achieved is the display of IO-error 0x0069. But, since this is
the beta release of the SDK for NT and not of NT, Microsoft does

Ofranko. Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a 
self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist, Hamaza should 
take your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore, you even deny the 
obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of 
the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be 
studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the 
horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians
and their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic 
homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied 
by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up 
the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory 
to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime 
of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making 
reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded
genocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5
million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920. Still denying the obvious?

""In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days.""

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""

 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:

 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the

""An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection, and it 
 appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away, it might be
 able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian
 civilization. An Armenian legion was organized 'to expel the Turks from
 the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
 Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.'[162] Thousands of Armenians from
 Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients,
systemic candida infection.  I think ""The Yeast Connection"" is
a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught, anyway?

Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the
mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, 
depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.

beyond 'rational thought' and then ring the changes.

z.B. The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one.
And in these times of economic difficulty, the Washington
legislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from
$4.25 (the federal level) to $4.90 (fifteen cents over
Oregon's).
	It would seem to me that this increase does not
keep pace with inflation, that the minimum wage should be
to $6.08 by my figures, so it is proposed that we raise
the minimum wage to $6.50 per hour by 1 July and then give
a 10% cost of living increase every 4 July.

and anyone who doesn't like it is obviously a country club

Why not?  It hasn't been released, so there's no way for you to evaluate it

"""Hate the sin but love the sinner""...I've heard that quite a bit recently, 
often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality...
but the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that
statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.

Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed
since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin. Now lets apply our ""hate the sin..."" philosophy and see
what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the 
stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and 
do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even 
believe what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins
to hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly
cannot be a good way to build love.

In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he 
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We
need to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love 
with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to
love someone is to pray for them.

I think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, 
or dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign 
that he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's
way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that
we can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a 
pure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy
even when he dreams.

Dreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples
of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  

Regarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be
careful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially
if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.
Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate
an out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE
might actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.
In II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught
up into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really
leave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a
spirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters
that much.  Paul could not tell.  

Be that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan
to experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a 
place until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If
God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His
own sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are
just taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking
an OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was
caught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some
Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one
time.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it.

"[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]

R. Scroggs

     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and
suggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a
""Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic
terminology.""  The term is derived from Lev 18""22 & 20:13 where the LXX
juxtaposes the two words arsenos (""male"") and koiten (""bed""), and represents
the Hebrew miskab zabar (""lying with a male"").   Yet he believes that Paul did
not originate the term, but borrowed it from ""circles of Hellenistic Jews
acquainted with rabbinic discussions"" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid
""contact with the usual Greek terminology"" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs
observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions
of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to
native-speaking Greeks (108).

     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the
object of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's ""learned discussion""
(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of ""one who lies with a
male"" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),
which Scroggs interprets as ""the effeminate call-boy,"" arsenokoitai is the
active partner ""who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on
occasion to satisfy his sexual desires"" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not
refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic
model of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he
affirms (109).
     This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The
combination of pornoi (""fornicators""), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (""slave
dealers"") refers to ""male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave
dealers [who procure them]"" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of
pederasty ""which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual
purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males"" (121).  Even ""serious
minded pagan authors"" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these
instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently
general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. 
Consequently Paul ""Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind"" (122).
We cannot know what Paul would have said about the ""contemporary model of
adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships"" (122).

     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical
concerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of
vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and
function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any
relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually
nonexistent.  He concludes that Paul ""does not care about any specific item in
the lists"" (104). 

     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary
phenomenon of a ""catalogue of vices,""  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are
""irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today"" (129).  The ""model
in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model
attacked by the NT"" that ""Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not
relevant to today's debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational
discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify
refusal of ordination. . . "" (127).

      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI

D. Wright

     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have
come under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's
view is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out
several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults
Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev
18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the ""Apostolic
Constitutions,""  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). 
Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term
derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This
is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's
claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the
gender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean ""a male who sleeps with
a male,"" making arseno- the object.

     Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the
term, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that
compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it
as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely
one of dialectical diversity: ""No semantic import attaches to the difference
between the two forms"" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which
the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its
object and where ""the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its
gender"" (132). 

     It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright
takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. 
For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,
androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male
homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion.  Boswell fails to cite
Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the
Syriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to
the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). 

     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in
parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the
dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this
parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (""adultery""), porneia
(""fornication""), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris
(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the
Ten Commandments as ""You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (""you shall not commit
adultery""), ou paidophthoreseis (""you shall not practice homosexuality with
boys""), you shall not steal. . ."" (150 n. 43).

     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (""commit homosexuality"") exists in the
Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was
coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by
Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38).

     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew
upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John
the Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of
homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.

     Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be
absent ""from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted
(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to
the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used
dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.
Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing
Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). 

     Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention
(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,
omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a
long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom
1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.  Wright
observes that Boswell has ""signally failed to demonstrate any us of
arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual
activity"" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature
and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly
specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. 

     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim
and I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning
""homosexual"" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of
the word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited
conclusion based on them.

     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the
catalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed
in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of
homosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the
part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into
being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke ""generally of
male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual
engagement with paides"" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were
interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).

     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning
homosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and
others who limit the term to ""active male prostitutes"" or pederasty are without
significant support from linguistic and historical studies.  ",society.religion.christian.error,religion.biblical interpretation.biblical exegesis.scriptural interpretation

The only way to change ESPN's thinking, if it is even possible, is to complain
to them directly.  Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct?  

I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when
they didn't show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted
to watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra
inning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN's
morning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.

My wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!

While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around,
Gant wasn't ordered back in the box ""sooner"", he was ordered back immediately.
As soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box.
Now, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches.  The only reason
he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call.  I expect his
concentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's
best to be as calm as possible.  Contributing factors would be Gant's
bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring
drought.

Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is
telling you to get in there.  You know the umpire is going to do something
(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.

But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chip
he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reason
to want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn't been wasting time all
game.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.
The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.
Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little
slack?  For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the
game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key
situation.  Did he have a date to get to?

And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game.

"I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is
the following;

From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having
it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the
listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some
reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  

Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? 

Please post or mail any answers or comments.

I certainly agree with the last paragraph.  Also, Jesus;s statements on
hell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as
was much of his other teaching.  There's more than enough hell here on earth
that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter
to me.  And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift
God offers.  Eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start
partaking of the divine nature and journeying on the path to deification.

# There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
# mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean,
# however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The
# entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews
# to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
# them, and which had been denied to them for millenia.
# 
# On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the

# damage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies
# of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and
# bigotry.

  Or, for that matter, with the USA.  Around here, nobody reroutes
  freeways to avoid churches, synagogues, and so forth.  They just
  get condemned, paid off, and the road goes through.  The same is
  standard policy for any number of other public projects: schools
  and sports arenas being only two examples.

"The Andrew Consortium
          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon 
                         is pleased to announce

                          AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2
                                 4/26/93

The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was
developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other
platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to
the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its
application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the
internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory
./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5"" diskette can be
ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address
below. 

The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the
same host.

Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows
AUIS to compile under AIX3.2.

-----------

The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment
on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media
applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the
capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that
not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but
also  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,
equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can
themselves contain other objects, including text.

AUIS has three components:

    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set
    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help
    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell
    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various
    available types of objects. 

    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented
    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein
    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,
    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as
    easily as those that come with the system. 

    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface
    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail
    management strategies and implements many advanced  features
    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of
    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails
    of related messages, and subscription management. It also
    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function
    workstations. 

The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for
the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards
for multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of
the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new
editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.


Remote Andrew Demo Service

You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew
Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11
window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate
through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System
to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and
newsgroups.

To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the
following command on your machine:

"My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange
pedal axle, in other words, I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down

riding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the
bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned
that it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the
front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find
there. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange
axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, in
addition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove the
sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.

I would put it stronger than that.  I consider it nonsense.

Simply put, I do not see any way that a ""Platonic essence"" could have
any *real* existance.  ""Essence"" in the Platonic sense does not have
any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept
invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
other ways.

So, to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that
does not exist!!  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave
the unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence',
thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.

Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be
secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes
of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one.

Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, ""Hey, 
let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!"" -- that's fine. It's
entirely another to say, ""Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town
and move it!"" 

Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but
from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that
they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000
level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he
was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets
thing as an excuse. 

I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and
the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the
parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the
whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the
NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond 
me. I only hope they get a new team soon.

Parts of Sen. Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today:

   Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary.  You are required to speak
   diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you
   my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to 
   participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory.
   ...
   What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference,
   timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy.
   ...
   After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us
   to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the
   right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe
   havens' for the Bosnians...
   Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and
   religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say
   that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims
   were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression
   instead of Serbian aggression.

Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which 
pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger
within the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin
to predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:

   I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear
   this is a big deal... so they will understand.

and it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of
self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have 
aided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo has
forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy
weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such
conditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a ""divide-and-conquer""
game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common
interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) 
to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.

One final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has
said in Rome last week that ""In practice, the embargo had the opposite
effect intended.  It made aggression certain.""

All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace
while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed
to this tragedy.

"*** On 04-19-93  03:53, Wayne Mcdougall had the unmitigated gall to say this:

 WM> The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the
 WM> screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware
 WM> for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

 Yes.  Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two
 disks at once.  Duplexing, which is the preferred way of mirroring, uses
 two controller cards and two disk drives.  Duplexing requires a special
 card and two identical disk drives (in most cases).  Duplexing can
 sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives/controllers, as long
 as the sizes are the same.

 WM> So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

 The configuration is completely up to the user.

 WM> 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this
 WM> what is causing my serialization error?

 If you only have one disk, then you can't use Level II SFT.  However, the
 OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different
 version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error.  Make sure
 that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the
 NetWare installation set.

 WM> 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives,
 WM> one of which has failed?

 Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I, or one volume
 mirrored using SFT II.  Impossible to tell with the network being down.

 WM> 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it
 WM> will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive?

 Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and
 installing the software as one volume under SFT I.  If the software will
 install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work
 in this configuration.

 WM> 4. What else can cause a serialization error?

 See the comment concerning the serial number on the OSOBJ installation
 floppy.

   . . . David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,
   'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud.

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there
   isn't a mechanism for the others either.

What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""?
Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.

_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
least it was a good try...",science.space.error.error,astronomy.gamma ray bursters.distance measurements.isotropic distribution.parallax measurements.parallax observations.distance indicators

While working on my shareware toolbar, I found myself 'eating' resources,
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK, and specifically the debug
kernel. Once you have all the SDK stuff installed, (this also comes with
VC++), you run 'n2d' which does a 'normal-to-debug' swap. The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower, but you then execute the command
DBWIN, and let it report to you what is going on. You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to, and possibly about other
peoples Apps (is that OPA?..I'm sorry).

Far from being ""tossed out,"" the gospels are taken, almost
universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.
I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who ""tosses out""
the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,
but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb
ascribes this more broadly.

Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is
why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far
outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels
*not* taken as ""gospel truth"" that faithfully records just what
happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and
the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken
this way by a critical reader.

There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,
measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the
text as ""historically valid"" or ""tosses out"" the text.  I suspect
this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and
secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,
and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present
historical arguments along these lines for their religious
program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary
school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better
such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed
above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if
it bit him on the keister twice.

Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts
and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are
historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I
have never seen a notion of ""historical validity"" that makes any
sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as
telling the ""gospel truth"" about historical events, in the way
that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and
secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite
author's history of whatever.)

Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some
person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every
text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can
we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does
the text provide evidence?

The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of
Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical
evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the 
vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The
modern American history textbooks that whitewash ""great American
figures"" are historical evidence.  These are all historical
evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all
that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that
Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that ""great
American figures"" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.
They are better evidence that some people ""saw"" the Maharishi,
late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians
thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe
""saw"" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an
educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather
than teach history.

How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of
historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a
very complex question that has no easily summarized answer.
There are many books on the subject or various parts of the
subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's ""Historian's Fallacies""
as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy
to read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy
to read.  Give it a try.",talk.religion.miscellaneous.error,religion.bible interpretation.textual criticism.historical evidence evaluation.historical evidence interpretation.text interpretation.text analysis.text reliability assessment.text as historical evidence

"This would be susceptible to fading, multi-path etc. We used to use a
system at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa. It used a
10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured.
The 10 GHz was just the carrier: the real signals were several switched
ones around 7.5 MHz or so, whose relative phases at the receiver would
read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed. The units
came with psychrometers (sp?) to measure the relative humidity and

Curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life
recently.  God's experience of time is so completely different from our own,
since He is both within and without it.  Using words like ""foreknowledge""
and ""predestination"" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing
God's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and
ending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no ""before""
when He did not know, so he could not have ""foreknowledge"" of our lives or
a time when he could have ""predestined"" our actions.  In fact, since our
understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I
would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our
free will interacts with God's control of the universe.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.time and free will.divine perspective.temporal perception.temporal understanding.temporal coexistence.divine omniscience.temporal perspective.temporal and divine interaction

Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the
standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we
can ask:
1. Is it authoritative?
2. Is it prophetic?
3. Is it authentic?
4. Is it dynamic?
5. Is it received, collected, read and used?

On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.
To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:
1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms.
2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred Scripture.
3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.
4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling.


But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that
the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and
it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw
them out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't
accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical
precedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the
apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead
body' that it was included in the catholic canon.


How do you then view the words: ""I warn everyone who  hears the
words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to
them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.
And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city"" (Rev 22.18-9)
Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.

It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John
10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the 
OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51
taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say
Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.


I am not familiar with the book.

NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,
only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue
of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a ""Hot Prospect"". Now, NeXT is nearing release
of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to
the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and
Motorola hardware.

NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression
486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo
in San Francisco.

The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are  
interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by!

The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without
any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box
labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one
in the center has the grayish board exposed.  On the left is some 
fiberglass board that looks green to me.  I see no reason
for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).

I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
low noise microwave preamps?  Often, microwave circuits have odd
bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary
to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  A
solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind 
the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.  (Q dope
for coils *does* not improve the Q--it just holds things together with
minimal loss).

I don't think I've changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that
a painless execution was not a cruel one.  I didn't say what would be
considered cruel, only that a painless death wasn't.  Now, cruelty must
involve some sort of suffering, I believe.  I don't think someone that gets
shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging
probably produces one sharp instance of pain, but it's over so quickly...


Pardon?


No.  Well, again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel, but I don't
think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some
are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.


Anything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation
asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the
gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  I'd say that any pain that
lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may
be an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).",alternative.atheism.error.error,cruelty.execution methods.duration of pain.duration of suffering.nature of pain.nature of cruelty.criteria for cruelty

You know, I'm a Ford fan, I must say, so I'm looking forward to the next
Mustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable
than the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.  

The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,
just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is
barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that
can only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line
with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;
it's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come
with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're
getting better and making the move in the right direction.

They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only
in words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't
press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.
Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.

I do not put much stock in the mag rags' ""inside"" information, or even
Ford rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it's entirety.  ""Inside"" information had the
Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look
for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself
if you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new
car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those
modular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and
competition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,
who really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.
Highly.

The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts
way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage
is more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that.

I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit
defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,
intelligent, critical spews like, ""The Mustang bites, man!""  Some of
you are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
will be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the
differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.
The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its
cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still
reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to
the driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while
the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.
Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be
no clear winner.

Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe
that it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?

"Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993.
It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but
it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think
it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. 

(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)

Topics
------

Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,
Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.

Episode Summary
---------------

Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This
was a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the
characters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the
Cat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.

Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs
game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players ""They
won in their building, we're going to win in ours"".

Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour
has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he
got 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that
he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible
for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour
from the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk
resulting in a goal.

On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in
the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed
however, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells
the Leaf players ""Don't let them score on you"".

Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal
won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner
disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don
thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of
instant replay.

On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning
the series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.
Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his
play.

Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance
during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying
that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's
new rules. ""This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its
all hack and slash."" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the
problems.

Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings
GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray
was shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination
of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article
in which Murray makes the following statements: ""Players don't fight
because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.
Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing
each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there
wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.""

Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to ""smarten up"" with
fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used
to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,
someone gets cut every period.

   Jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the
Catholic Church.  The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is
considered to be God or part of ""the Godhead.""  Therefore it implies no
such thing about the feminine in general.

   Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was
announced ""out of the blue.""  This also is incorrect, as dogma is only
the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition.  This dogma
has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the

Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the ""bigotry"" is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.
The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'
or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.
The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun
cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).


 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.

 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.

According to Karakashian:

As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,
this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in
the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.  

Saint Martin:

The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians
as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs
as Ermeniyye.
 
Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'
which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a
place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, 
while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and 
therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.

G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary ""Haik""
is the diminutive form of ""Hai"", and that ""Hai"" is the name of our
nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word ""Armen"" that
foreigners apply to our people.'

It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is 
the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way
connected with the word 'Hai'.

Haik and Haiastan:

Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom
the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance
between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,
in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of
Khoren.

Haiasa:

The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were
no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the 
region known as Armenia.

Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite
inscriptions for Upper Armenia.'

Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is
identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a
Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown
that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.

Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with 
no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.

The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious
that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.

Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and
'Haiastan' entered our older works.

According to Karakashian: 

'The word ""Haik"" is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it
ever found employed in the forms ""Haika"" or ""Haykazn"".

Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he
improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from ""Hai"" or ""Haik"" they could 
also have used the words ""Haikak"" and ""Haykazn"" in a number of
places.'

According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite 
inscriptions:

'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality
or species. The words ""Haddanas"", ""Haddina"" were used by the 
Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the
""d"" between the two ""a"" letters to ""y"" ""Hadinasdani"" was in this
way transformed to ""Haiastan""'.

Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'
and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a 
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' 
which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.
Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case
it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The
suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which
refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.

E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological 
and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.

The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,
above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties
with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.

According to J. Deniker:

From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are 
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their
average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.
They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of 
85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic
family.

Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:

The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,
but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little
above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. 

Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between
Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a 
distinct race.

"I am quite near sighted.

I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to ""weld"" this back in place as well.

My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the
treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
- several each hour.

The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.

I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most
interest to me:

If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action?

If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect
afterwards.

Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Armenians have been doing just that for a long, long time.

Source: ""Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of 1972 Terror Attack at
Munich Olympic Games,"" The Armenian Reporter, February 7, 1985, p. 1.

""Le Matin, the influential Paris daily, based on unidentified sources,
claimed last week that Hagop Hagopian, the founder and leader of one
faction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA),
was among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters
of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games...

Le Matin added that up to 1982, Hagopian operated out of Beirut, Lebanon,
but escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city. It was
about this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr. Hagopian
was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force,
although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and
well and presently is residing alternately in Damascus, Syria, and
Athens, Greece. The paper also noted that the socialist government of
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his P.A.S.O.K. party accepted the
Armenian underground leader with ""open arms"" and still providing him
with assistance simply because of Greece's traditional enmity with Turkey.

Le Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its
expenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause, with the rest 
coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in
drug trafficking.""

Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style
with extreeme Machismo. Perhaps thats not the way to handle
it. 

It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many
have done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisons
with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous.

Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your
post desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made some
very good points about how a low key approach might have been 
more effective.

The point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govt
played the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. They
had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they 
just were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be?

If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps
be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed
in the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made the
same mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in
for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I would
because with all those press about its very difficult not to try
the macho stuff.


The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access
to. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was
cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They
knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This
may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have 
been a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used
the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny that
few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the
death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted
to arrest their former ally.



Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired
on the police helicopter. No matter whether the warrant was or
was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out 
thought that it was. Thus the assault on them was completely
inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to
employ.

Of course we have to consider the guns issue. That is the whole
core of the question. Everything else is a diversion.

available through anonymous ftp (see information below). In addition to the
change in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages
(eliminating many extraneous ""that's"" and ""of's""), and many (minor) errors
have been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story,
testimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a ""Words-to-Know""
glossary.

As with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a
not-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome
to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the
actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge
anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit
from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself
for the precise terms.

Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the
printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound

of printed copies once everything has been worked out.

""The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon"" is currently available in postscript and
RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made
available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to
print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple
Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in
the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work
better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in
by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the
Macintosh and Windows. If you don't have a postscript printer, you may be
able to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.

Armenian Raid Leaves Azeris Dead or Fleeing:

""...about 1,000 of Khojaly's 10,000 people were killed in Tuesdays attack. 
 Azerbaijani television showed truckloads of corpses being evacuated from 
 the Khocaly area.""

 The Washington Times, 3/2/92

Atrocity Reports Horrify Azerbaijan :

""Azeri officials who returned from the seen to this town about nine miles 
 away brought back three dead children, the backs of their heads blown off...
 'Women and children had been scalped,' said Assad Faradzev, an aide to 
 Karabagh's Azeri governor.  Azeri television showed pictures of one 
 truckload of bodies brought to the Azeri town of Agdam, some with their 
 faces apparently scratched with knives or their eyes gouged out.""

Massacre By Armenians Being Reported:

""The Republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had 
 killed 1,000 [Azeris]... But dozens of bodies scattered over the 
 area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre.""

Killings Rife in Nagorno-Karabagh, Moldova:

""Journalists in the area reported seeing dozens of corpses, including some 
 of the civilians, and Azerbaijani officials said Armenians began shooting 
 at them when they sought to recover the bodies.""
 Fred Hiatt
 The Washington Post, 3/3/92

Bodies Mark Site of Karabagh Massacre:

""A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijanis to collect their dead 
 and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest.  All are the bodies 
 of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clorhing of workers. Of the 31 
 we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing 
 uniform.  All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small
 children. Two groups, apparently families, had fallen together, the children 
 cradled in the women's arms.  Several of them, including one small girl, had 
 terrible head injuries: only her face was left. Survivors have told how they 
 saw Armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground.""
 Anatol Lieven
 The Times (London), 3/3/92

Karabagh Survivors Flee to Mountains:

""Geyush Gassanov, the deputy mayor of Khocaly, said that Armenian troops 
 surrounded the town after 7 pm on Tuesday. They were accompanied by six 
 or seven light tanks and armoured carriers.  'We thought they would just 
 bombard the village, as they had in the past, and then retreat.  But they 
 attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.'  
 Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their 
 way through the mountains to safety. 'For two days we crawled most of the 
 way to avoid gunfire,' Sukru Aslanov said.  His daughter was killed in the 
 battle for Khodjaly, and his brother and son died on the road.""
 Anatol Lieven
 The Times (London), 3/3/92

Corpses Litter Hills in Karabagh:

""As we swooped low over the snow covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw 
 the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as 
 they ran...Suddenly there was a thump...[our Azerbaijani helicopter] had 
 been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post...""
 Anatol Lieven
 The Times (London), 3/4/92

""Police in western Azerbaijan said they had recovered the bodies of 
 120 Azerbaijanis killed as they fled an Armenian assault in the 
 disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabagh and said they were blocked from 
 recovering more bodies.""
 The Wall Street Journal, 3/4/92

Exiting Troops Attacked in Nagorno-Karabagh:

""Withdrawal halted;  Armenians Blamed...
 More video footage and reports from Khocaly paint a grim picture of 
 widespread civilian deaths and mutilation...
 One woman's feet appeared to have been bound...""

   searching out our deceased ancestors so that we can perform the
   ordinances -- such as baptism, confirmation, and marriage for time and
   eternity -- that are required for a person to obtain salvation through
   Christ and to live with Him through the eternities. These are people
   who may have not had the opportunity to know Christ in their lifetime,
   so we are making it possible for Christ's saving grace (I know there
   are thousands of interpretations of that phrase) to become fully
   effective for them if they allow it to do so on the other side.


This paragraph brought to mind a question.  How do you (Mormons) reconcile
the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection
people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?

        Only guessing, but from his address I'd say that Jerry, like
        me, lives in Canada. Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in
        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen
        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.

        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and
        ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the
        objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's
        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any
        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't
        like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often
        blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed
        Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme
        Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to
        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).

        Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of
        it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we
        have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the
        War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional
        powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more
        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the
        War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop
        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective
        suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our
        Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend
        off a bent cop.

        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and
        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order,
        while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government
        is getting in-your-face liberty.

        That's not to say our time won't come. It looks like Chretien
        is going to run on a law-and-order platform. Be afraid.

And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from
an unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims 
with Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in 
various units in the German Wehrmacht, according to Ara J. Berkian. 
14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units, 6,000 in German army 
units, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS.[1]

A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France,
Greece, Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit
themselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that

""Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion 
Armenienne.'""[2]

That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided
with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of
Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

[2] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), in 'The Armenian 
    Displaced Persons,' ibid., p. 19.

In fall 1942, the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed,
to be followed by battalions 810, 812 and 813 in spring 1943. In the 
second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created.
These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were
attached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were
the field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed between
May 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the
Nazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be
included.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.
Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours 
red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'

While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the
Second World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's
defeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces,
hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim 
population would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national
sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America
for his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish
government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.

	Not necessarily.  As Shai points out, political appointments are
based on power.  They are also based on favors owed, coalition
building, and deal making.  While this may have a racist element to
it, I think that its much more fair to attribute it to the ""old boy""
nature of politics.  Now, I'll freely admit that the old boy system
has racist and sexist effects, but I don't think that those are its
purpose, whether in the US, Israel, or elsewhere.



	Here again, you miss out on the old boy nature of politics,
and the existance of back-room deals.  As individuals, these arabs may
not be as well connected as the Jew who gets the job.  I don't like
this aspect of politics, but I understand it exists.

We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also
shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by
about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only
1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What
is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due
mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is
more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at
different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the
stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon
right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see
a smeared effect where they overlap.
  Example:
  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)
      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)

Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when
rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces
with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as
you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the
system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the
application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.
Bravo!

This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the
status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue
predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the
""deuteroncanonicals"" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put
them after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the
Hebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he
reports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just
dictating his translation to an amanuensis.

That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in
Western Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the
first steps in ""reducing"" these books from the status they had (and have)
among the Greeks.

Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers ""threw out"" these
books.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome
had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should
not be based on citations from these ALONE.

I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it
seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as
part of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)
are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems
to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow
""more inspired"" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable
-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in
Greek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a
big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current
""inerrancy"" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of
the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If
we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is
surely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of
course, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it
would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the
Hebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which
led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.

Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical
odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three
straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins
winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't
include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker
team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made
the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as
good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though!
It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie
Gibson :-)


Moog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4
starts.  Fuhr has been too tough.  Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in
time...I mean, after all, Buffalo is 3 wins, 7 losses in their last 10.


It's very frustrating to lose, and you've gotta say something.  Actually
it's not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game.  But when the
competition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about
who wins or loses :-)


I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away.
They lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1.

I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others
may not have the reference.

""And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion,
or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach
them not to understand the doctrine of repentance,
faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of
baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying
on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be
upon the heads of the parents.""

What is ""the sin"" of the parents?



Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle.
However, it assumes that fathers and sons have 
equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.

Parents are responsible to teach their children
the Gospel and other life skills.  Should they
fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their 
children, the parent would be held responsible
-- not for their children's sins, but for not
teaching them properly.

Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position 
of authority in either the family or the church He
expects that person to teach those in his charge.

In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others 
is likened to ""a watchman unto the house of Israel.""
""If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from 
his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but
his blood will I require at thine hand.
Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to 
turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he
shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
delivered thy soul.""

Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with
""parents have children in Zion"" I believe all
parents are responsible for teaching their children 
whatever good principles they understand.

and could be judged more strictly.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.parental responsibility.teaching responsibilities.teaching doctrines.parental instruction.parental accountability.teaching obligations.parental religious instruction

There are exactly ZERO verses that ""clearly"" address the issues.


The kind of interpretation I see as ""incredibly perverse"" is that applied
to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual
behavior and rape.  Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context
should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander
-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.


The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_
in this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of
activity that could be named by ""fornication"" or ""theft"" or ""coveting"" or
""reviling"" or ""drunkenness"" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all ""clear"" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest
in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,
with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated
Christian discussion of ALL these areas.

Homosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I
know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and
child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly
""harmless"" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --
that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter
you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that
you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]

	""'I am free to do anything,' you say.  Yes, but not everything
	is for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one
	will not let anything make free with me.""  [1 Cor. 6:12]

Which is a restatement that we must have no other ""god"" before God.  A
commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some
people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.
It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary
argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such
behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers.

I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.
Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your
assumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of
which Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine
them.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are ""moral"" and
which ones are ""ritual.""  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).
And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus
from the ""ritual law"" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.

I'm dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this
matter) about how ""repulsive"" and ""unnatural"" our acts are -- and what
do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of
arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating
insects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you
say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part
of the ritual law?

For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can
be ""law"" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to
determine why you ""pick"" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the
whole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: ""No doubt I am free to do anything.""
But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,
the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go
through Leviticus and decide each ""command"" there on that basis, then
your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this
context, it is remarkably offensive to say:


Well, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously
(though one can always find jokers) in ""defense"" of bestiality.  It is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human
adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not
mine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so.

Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,
the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to
love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-
ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get
in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.

Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every
corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same
old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never
even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with
the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great
emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even
taking the trouble to find out what it is.

Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.
WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to
condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN
to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?
God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or
condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in
insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are
SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.

Why, for God's sake?

	""For God did not send the Son into the world
	to condemn the world,
	but that the world might be saved through him.
	Whoever believes in him is not condemned,
	but whoever does not believe has already been condemned
	for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son.
	Now the judgment is this:
	the light has come into the world,
	but men have preferred darkness to light
	because their deeds were evil.
	For everyone who practices wickedness
	hates the light,
	and does not come near the light
	for fear his deeds will be exposed.
	But he who acts in truth
	comes into the light,
	so that it may be sh0own
	that his deeds are done in God.""	John 3:17-21

For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from
evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and
rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*
show a sinful shunning of God's light.  Blessed are those whose spirits
have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified.

However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity;
and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who
fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow
it with the darkness of false witness against us.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.interpretation of scripture.interpretation of religious texts

will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because
I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I

and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually
felt refreshed the next morning.

	So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and

presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The
antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought

notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about

                             April 30, 1993

DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)
at approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34
meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM
yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days.

As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to
command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.",science.space.error.error,space exploration.spacecraft operations.fault protection.signal acquisition.signal loss.fault diagnosis.signal reacquisition.ephemeris check.ephemeris failure.ephemeris failure analysis.ephemeris check failure.ephemeris failure impact

I know for sure that the Everex Magic I/O EV-170A can be jumpered
for a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional I/O mode.

Also, I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following
about the Monochrome Display & Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer
Adapter:

    It is essential that the external device not try to pull these
    lines [referring to the data lines] to ground.

And later:

    If an external device should be driving data on these pins (in
    violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this
    data will be `or'ed with the latch contents.

I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind
as a result of my saying, ``I DO NOT know for sure, but I think
you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input
port by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the
data lines, while an external device drives them.''  The input
data will not be latched, so noise could make this infeasible.",science.electronics.error.error,hardware.parallel port configuration.parallel port usage.parallel port safety and usage guidelines.parallel port input usage.parallel port input risks

Do you know of the world-wide-web?  This is a global hypertext (well, 
hypermedia) network running on the internet.  One of the nice things
about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the
other systems being used, like WAIS, Gopher, FTP, Archie, etc.  It
is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web.

If you'd like to explore, I'd suggest getting the XMosaic program,
written at the NCSA.  It's an X-windows web browser, and is pretty
slick.  It can understand and cope with more than text: gif, jpeg, mpeg,
audio, etc.  There are other browsers, including a text-mode browser
for people stuck on a text terminal, but I'm most familliar with mosaic.

Under the page ""The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Subject Catalogue""
(this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic, or by any
browser via the URL 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html )
there is a subject ""Space Science.""  Currently this points to a
page under construction, with only the NASA JPL FTP archive.  I've
volunteered to take over this page, and in fact I have a replacement
with all sorts of information pointers (mostly gleaned from the
sci.space FAQ).  As soon as the overworked ""Subject Catalogue"" 
maintainer switches the ""Space Science"" pointer, it'll be visible.

I'll post a short note when this happens.

"People who criticize ""big Government"" and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
long-term.  

(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to
compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)

As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve
itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should
drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But
the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or
some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So
the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a
lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,
doesn't it?)

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to
cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new
technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,
despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly
earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in
new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little
sense to try to save money.

Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY
disagrees about that the wisdom should be.  

It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects.
GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry
has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large
construction project now uses these tools.

I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in 
Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional

will have an effect.  And it doesn't say much for the mentality of 
anybody it works on, either.

"      I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act
   on the export of cryptographic technology, however, is it illegal to
   transmit encrypted data from the U.S. to another country?  If so,
   then which laws apply to this situation?

From the US law perspective, unless you're engaging in illegal speech,
it's not illegal to use encryption.  Yet.  The NSA is allowed to try
to listen, but you're not obligated to make it easy for them.  Yet.
The other country may have more repressive laws about that;
I gather France's bureaucracy wants to know what you're saying, 
and in the old Soviet Union, they didn't need laws to make things illegal :-(

(paranoia follows, for those of you who want to play it safe :-)
The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies, but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate RSA's patents, e.g. if you use PGP, the
NSA may tell RSA that you're doing so, and if the Secret Service catches on,
they may decide that the mere fact that RSA hasn't filed a lawsuit
against you doesn't mean that you don't deserve to have your computer
confiscated for possible patent violation, munitions law violation,
espionage, money laundering, drug importation, and creatin' a disturbance,
and then not give it back because you *did* violate the patent even

This is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement.  In particular, are you
referring to the native American culture that existed in 1400, or the one
that existed in 1800?  (Simplify things by assuming we're talking about
the eastern US rather than the whole continent.)  Given that those were
*radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to?


Note that the pre-Columbian native Americans, east of the Mississippi,
did all of these things.  (Well, maybe not ""on Sunday"", but they did
have organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.)  If
you are judging the native Americans by the tribal culture that existed
in 1800, you might want to read an account of the De Soto expedition
to find out what pre-Columbian native American culture, at least in the
more civilized parts of the continent, was like.",science.space.error.error,culture.historical culture.native american culture.pre-columbian culture.tribal culture.historical periods.cultural evolution.cultural periods

It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is
usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car
with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
poorer Cd. 

To calculate drag use this formula:

D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S

Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),
V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the
pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). 

Note that power is:

P = F * v

Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v
is velocity (ft/s). 

Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for
force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power
result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. 

So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top
speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)

101 mph

Sorry to dissappoint.

The events I saw were:
1)  Called strike by Hirschbeck
2)  Shocked-looking Gant asks for appeal to first
3)  No appeal to first
4)  Gant steps out of batters box.
5)  Hirschbeck *immediately* orders Gant back in.  [bad move]
6)  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]
7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent.
8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
9)  Pitch is called a strike.
10)  Cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)
11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere
12)  Play finally resumes.

Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

There are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very
wide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal.
No private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve ...
and as our private sector has discovered, they're better off not
offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.
(-;


The alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out,
doctors opted out, or both).  But that only for insurance ... and you
can't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they
will not offer.  And remember that the actual health care is delivered
by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.
Again, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.

Plus, there is the matter of culture and values ... I'm basically
anti-tax and anti-government, by Canadian standards ... yet I can't
bring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that I
understand where you're coming from.  Up north, you're so much more
likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health
insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...


Yes, primarily in Quebec and in Alberta.  Sorry, I musta lost you in
that verbose blurb ...


In Canada and Germany, it's not mandatory.  However, it is negative
option in that you must request the exemption.  That the private
sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option
(as in the Quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...


Yes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are
too small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so
you pretty well have to be a GP to get paid.  And if you do get
the training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a
licence because there is already someone in the business and who
cannot fill his/her appointment book.  That we have a CMA doctors
monopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby
NEVER tells you down here ...


No, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends
are (-;) but there's the question of our small market dynamics up
north ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell
their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate
their effective population served, and thus make some specialties
finally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  We just do
not have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.


Uh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness
funds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're
all interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in
our German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in
Saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes
by province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations
and regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have
the same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have
public health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities
(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra
insurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,
was one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).

Remember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cos
Rochester does and they're also a company town.


I'll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim, but
I've come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about
our ""system"".  If much or some of it were true, you'd have to take
us for idiots for tolerating it.  And given that our insurance was
installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory
governments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still
chafing, they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
things ... think about it.  After all, we are using the U.S. as a
metric to make comparison ... both for keeping-up-with-the-Joneses
as for confirming that we did something right.

        Interesting, as I think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position

a BS degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year.  They also

practice, than a truly specialty field.  It will be even more
so in the future.

choose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field

scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon

Here you give positive, accurate ""facts"" about what happened to the beduins
and the land:

   After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev
   Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The
   10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of
   40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150
   mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out
   of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,
   spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin
   shepherds from roaming.

   A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.
   But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these
   Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure
   was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields
   in order that the land could be transferred to the army.

And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:

   No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held
   today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of
   the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized
   by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now
   confined to seven ""development towns"", or *sowetos*, established
   for them.

   (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:
   elias@ismennt.is)

So what you basically say is that ""we know for sure that nothing good happens
there now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived
and that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows about
what the Jews did there.""

Is that what you said?  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote?

BTW,  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis.  Not to mention
that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full
brigade of them.

\maketitle

A message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a
``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the
digest is easy, finding a message with a given
digest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the
same digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms
have many applications, including digital signatures and message
authentication.

RSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron
Rivest \cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.
Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a
second.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved}
secure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps
to a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$
operations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No
one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.

Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents
a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's
internal compression function, which maps
a 512-bit message block $x$ and a
128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output
state. They show how to find a message block $x$
and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same
output state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach
exploits structural properties of the collision function to find 
a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one
would expect.

Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of
MD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a
pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a
pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real
collision, since it involves two different messages, would almost
always involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that
$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same
message blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would
generally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are
the same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to
extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the
special pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.

It is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den
Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in
MD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions
and not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of
course, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and
other message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that
such algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.

telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm.  then
you'll see usenet discussions of the form: engine A has peak
vibrations 3 dB less than engine B, therefore engine A is better than
engine B.

   Yes, Mary is fully human.  However, that does not imply that she was
just as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that man's
nature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16).
In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human
than any of the rest of us.

   You ask why God cannot ""repeat the miracle"" of Mary's preservation
from Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be ""why _did_ He
not"" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was
obtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained
through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, as
God is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply
His Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before
Christ came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore,
Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and
were necessary even for Mary's salvation.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.immaculate conception.original sin.salvation.salvation through christ.salvation through grace.salvation through christ's sacrifice.mary's preservation from original sin.mary's salvation.mary's humanity and salvation

No disagreement at all that there is a VERY serious struggle going on.
But Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  That's quite
different from Hell Classic (TM). :-) Jesus doesn't sound like the
usual hell-fire type of preacher.  He attracts people through what he
does. And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of 
Lazarus and Dives, which is a parable!  In any case, my point is that
a fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice
and isn't Good News in a meaningful sense.  There are plenty of good 
reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal 
hell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between 
God and the Disloyal Opposition.  A faith based in fear is not built
on Rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  If the fear were
removed, there would BE no foundation.  

That's basically why it matters to me.  I think we have many Christians 
that DON'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God.
I cannot be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if
my response to God is motivated on fear.

good point.  the ""list"" actually started out as an extension of my GS
v. FJ shootout list, which is why it got that name.  since inception,
however, other boxer-interested folks have joined and the conversation
has not always been ""geared"" to gs/pd/st-specific topics.


when i raised the ""to expand or not to expand/that is the question""
question on the list itself, there were mixed feelings.  the list has
always been open to anyone with a non-bouncing ""from:"" line and there
has been general agreement that only boxer-related stuff is
appropriate.  almost all of the subscribers own R80/R100 GS/ST/PD
bikes, although some R, RT and RS owners are also on it.

at this point, my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace
and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as
possible.  the list is fairly technical, with ""how do i do this?"",
""what kind of that should i get?"" kinds of questions.  there has yet
to be any non-BMW bashing, K bike bashing, or ""any bmw mfg'd after
1962 is a piece of shit"" bashing.  such posts are, by consent of the
governed, proscribed.

if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the
net.boxer.owners, then i am not going to stand in the way of progress.

so, hesh, let me turn the question around: have you (or has anyone
else) not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded?

it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance

Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a
theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary ""After The
War"" is my main source. (I think I still have it on videotape.) Others
include The Nation and The Progressive.

The rest of the article is mere rationalisation. You may claim that
sanitation plants are strategic ""legitimate"" targets, but what happens to
the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the
civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals
can't handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?

And what exactly are your sources? We have all, I'm sure, seen Postol's
interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about
the Patriot's effectiveness; what is your source for the 70%
effectiveness you claim?

In any case, I don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism. How about
if we move it somewhere else?

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio, but I seem
to remember that PeP is actually 4x the ""real"" power.  Which makes 1KW PeP
actually around 250W.  Or was it 2x?  I disremember.

""Effective transmitted power"" is also ""odd"", in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry.  Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron
might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the
CN tower ;-).

This is like Sears HP ;-)

Though, 1500 real watts still isn't impossible.  About 125-150A with
a 12V alternator, less if the alternator produces higher voltages.

Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking 
method.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer
in one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with 
pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite
zone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes
away.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional 
to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.
This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.

Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their 
bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.",science.electronics.error.error,technology.tracking technology.motion detection.dance tracking.gesture detection.gesture tracking.signal detection.signal emission.signal emission methods

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not
actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on
real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode
and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does
is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes
sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different
directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its
reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.

I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case
there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I
passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then
the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With
other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.
But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there
was another trap.  And there was!

On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from
a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator
changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where
the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the 
place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector
that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the
car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would
have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar
trap when there was none.

I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features
to be useful and not gimmicks.

	We bought one from Relax technologies.  BIG mistake.  The drive
had some jumpers set incorrectly so it didn't work at first, and the
software they shipped with it was incompatable with the drive (it was the
new compression model), and worst of all, when I opened the drive up to
fiddle with the jumpers, I found the inside of the case COVERED WITH METAL

in the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive in.  This was
a HP drive, by the way, and is now working fine (knock on wood), no thanks
to Relax technologies.

Hey, your mileage may vary, but let me suggest that you NOT buy from Relax

"Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the 
compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes 
from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. 
Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits 
required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally 
out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local 
community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By 
the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame 
and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers 
and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, 
but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not 
have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the 
line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient 
equipment and water to make a difference.

They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia 
asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably 
irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local 
calls could get through.

ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who 
viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the 
standard ""pool shot""), and agreed that the fire a) must have been 
started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant 
to spread so fast.

Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed 
themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot 
stronger proof than some of the ""theories"" floating around the net.

modified tanks, would have prevented this tragedy. I bet you blamed

My wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason.  He let me look at some of the books
(which after his death his ""brothers"" came over and took from his greiving
widow before his body had even cooled).  Don't tell me you don't worship
Osiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's
Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British
Masonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black
mason.  I've talked with him, though much he likes to hide (""mystery""). 
Special handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to ""evangelize"" me,
he told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a
""mystery"" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of.
I haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired
apologist (can't remember his name) on TV, didn't exactly come to this same
conclusion.  

""Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally
represented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented
very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity
-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the
son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this
god, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none
other than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was
originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,
or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with
these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had
the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in
perfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,
considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to
Babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the
Masonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. 
He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian
goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of
Fortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally
celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the
buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall
characteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the
son of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by
Plutarch, that 'Osiris was black'.......""  Hislop

It was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his
cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told
me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he
started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months
to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately
repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)

Nimr-rod from Nimr, a ""leopard,"" and rada or rad ""To subdue.""  It is a
universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia
of the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of
some leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or
should I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the ""spotted
cow"".

I'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the ""mystery"" religions that all
find their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to
be a ""cold slap to the face"" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that
Masonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally
talked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating
yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?",society.religion.christian.error,religion.masonry.masonic symbolism.masonic origins.masonic rituals.masonic secrecy.masonic traditions.masonic mysteries

   When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention,
   the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a
   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,
   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the
   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to
   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the
   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved
   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I
   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but
   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not
   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)

It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what
happened at Fatima.  That's a bit strong, it is sort of like saying
that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a
Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being
called a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an
offense, but not a heretic.

Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent
one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by
God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due
to a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes
demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human
history.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.

""Approval"" of an apparition by the Church principally means that
whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.

I personally think of private revelations as our Lord's way of telling
us what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the
doctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in
knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.

Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of
apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem
at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into

    Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially
if you have a large (16"" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do
is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or
syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my
office. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no
reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
displyed on the monitor's tube.


    Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office
has been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any
problems. (Note: I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off
when I'm not actually working on the server itself.)",computer.system.mac.hardware,energy consumption.monitor power usage.monitor power management.monitor power conservation.monitor usage habits.monitor shutdown

                               Books -- Fiction

THOMAS M. DISCH

""The Santa Claus Compromise""
Short story.  The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and 
events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...

WALTER M. MILLER, JR

""A Canticle for Leibowitz""
One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives
copying blueprints from ""Saint Leibowitz"", filling the sheets of paper with
ink and leaving white lines and letters.

EDGAR PANGBORN

""Davy""
Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,
forbids that anyone ""produce, describe or use any substance containing...
atoms"". 

PHILIP K. DICK

Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short 
stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he
remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:

""Galactic Pot-Healer""
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.

""A Maze of Death""
Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.

""VALIS""
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

""The Divine Invasion""
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.

MARGARET ATWOOD

""The Handmaid's Tale""
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are
hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

VARIOUS AUTHORS

""The Bible""
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

PETER DE ROSA

""Vicars of Christ"", Bantam Press, 1988
Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very
enlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.

Droemer-Knaur, 1989)

MICHAEL MARTIN

""Atheism: A Philosophical Justification"", Temple University Press,
 Philadelphia, USA.
A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area.  Argues both for ""negative atheism"" (i.e. the ""non-belief in the
existence of god(s)"") and also for ""positive atheism"" (""the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)"").  Includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.
541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available)

""The Case Against Christianity"", Temple University Press
A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately)
demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent.
273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5

JAMES TURNER

""Without God, Without Creed"", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,
 MD, USA
Subtitled ""The Origins of Unbelief in America"".  Examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative
world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France
and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England
developments.  ""Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,
Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea, the belief that God exists."" 
316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4

GEORGE SELDES (Editor)

""The great thoughts"", Ballantine Books, New York, USA
A ""dictionary of quotations"" of a different kind, concentrating on statements
and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy
and world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many
people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various
people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of
the quotations are derived from Cardiff's ""What Great Men Think of Religion""
and Noyes' ""Views of Religion"".
490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.

RICHARD SWINBURNE

""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of
Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this
work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised
edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.

J. L. MACKIE

""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford
This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through
the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for
God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.

  So, in short, the 3/8"" cables seems to be pretty useless, I would guess.

  The larger cable seems to be a much better unit.

  I've got the larger cable - about 5/8"" inch in diameter (actually, I think
its larger), about 4 feet long which coils into a 8 or 9 inch coil, with the
tubular key lock like the U-locks.  It has worked fine for me for two years
now, and *seems* (to me, anyway) that it is very secure.  It doesn't have the
weaknesses that the U-locks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick
supposedly, is much easier to store in my tankbag than a U-lock, and more
versatile.  I got mine from one of the mail-order houses (Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse, I beleive), for $42.

  In combination with an ignition disable, and a couple of other deterrents,
all I *usually* worry about is vandalism.

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection 
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest 
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial 
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and 
mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).


Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.


Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses 
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(
new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline 
with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.
Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression 
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.


Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good 
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects 
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the 
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects 
of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).
 

Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my 
opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is 
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many 
infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some 
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection 
frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to 
result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the 
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms 
associated with the infection.


There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong 
immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, 
vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this 
is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low 
and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune 
response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are 
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of 
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe 
infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A 
status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for 
vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five 
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the 
others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.
But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the 
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also 
be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a 
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(
like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.
Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's 
what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves 
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training 
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good 
for getting general dietary advice from however.

":               WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE?

:   SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars,
:   wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the
:   proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part 
:   in three thousand to be cost-effective. 

Robin's calculation is interesting and important, even if it's off by
an order of magnitude (for example).

Even if hardware costs for the Clipper Chip phones were ZERO, the
protocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much
higher than the 1 part in 3 thousand...it depends on the exact details
of the phone call length, protocol, etc. (shorter calls get a
proportionately greater hit).

However, I suspect most Americans will not find this line of reasoning
as persuasive as the analogies about escrowing keys to one's house
are.

"   On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.
   To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:
   1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
   anachronisms.
   2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
   which are at variance with sacred Scripture.
   3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
   subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.
   4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
   Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and
   poetic and religious feeling.

First, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly
subjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book
of the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, in
some way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests.

Second, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of
their composition.  I don't recall the exact dating of all of the
books, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the
canonical books (i.e. Daniel).

Furthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been
originally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in
nature.  Both of these features probably figured heavily in the
rejection of these books from the various canons.

These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to
judge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have
shown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely
objective standards for determining canonicity.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.apocrypha.canonicity criteria.criteria for canonicity.historical and doctrinal accuracy.subjectivity in criteria application

While I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be
because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. Modern, 
ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed
orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The
opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based
telescopes. In any case, a bright point of light passing through
the field doesn't ruin observations. If that were the case, the
thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned,
they are extremely bright.)",science.space.error.error,astronomy.astronomical observations.light pollution.satellites.satellite impacts on astronomy.atmospheric effects on astronomy.atmospheric interference.atmospheric limitations on ground-based astronomy
"In response to alleged circular reasoning concerning the morality of      
homosexuality, clh poses the following challenge:


I answer,

The circle is simple to break.   The Church teaches that homosexual
behavior is immoral.  This teaching is raw, impassionate, unassailable
dogma.  That closes the argument for me.

When I say ""black,"" I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this
discussion.  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one 
team in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did.  


Don't know.  But remember: this is the country that had special racial
laws for one group and one group only: blacks.  Our national history 
includes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority; 
the hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been
the object of national obsession.


Absolutely.  As I said before, I expect that this effect is disappearing.
But it certainly did exist, and all out talk of TWG's and all that is 
not without some small reason.


Well, there's the list.  Go for it!  I'll cull some more names as I go.

"But wouldn't that go for any sin.  My father told me when he was growing
up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced.
There are a few verses prohibitting divorce.  Somehow, divorce became
acceptable (even in Catholicism anullments).  Certainly it is no longer
a sin to associate with a divorced person.  The point is that each person
has their own temptations to deal with.  Paul repeatedly talks about the
""thorn"" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but
who knows.  Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not ""compatible""
with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  The Bible
warns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges,
etc., etc.  I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians
who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them.  All those who have
given in to greed, get 'em outta here.  Jesus pointed out that he
was the physician for the sinners.  Any attempts to make homosexuals
feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible
with Christianity.  Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone
try to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away.  Does Jesus need
us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin.  Do we really mistrust 
Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?

Think about it.  Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and
the Pharisees.  The sinners he embraced and forgave.  The Pharisees,
hypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and
did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins.  What
I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins,
those sins will not be forgiven.  And since those guilty of even one sin
are guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others
are guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others
of.

The poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers, 
those who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed.",society.religion.christian.error,religion.forgiveness.mercy.sins and forgiveness.judgment and forgiveness.temptations and forgiveness.temptations and sin.tolerance and forgiveness.tolerance and acceptance.admission of sins.admission of sins and forgiveness.judgment and acceptance.tolerance and acceptance of sinners
